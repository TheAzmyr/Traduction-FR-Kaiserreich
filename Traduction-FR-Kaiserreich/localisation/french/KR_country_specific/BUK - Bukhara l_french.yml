 BUK_mohammed_alim_khan: "Mohammed Alim Khan"
 BUK_mohammed_alim_khan_leader_desc:9 "§YNaissance :§! §L3 janvier 1880, à Boukhara, Émirat de Boukhara§!\n§YCarrière :§! §LL'Émir Sayid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan a été préparé dès sa naissance à devenir le pion d'un empereur étranger. À treize ans, le jeune prince fut envoyé à Saint-Pétersbourg, où il étudia la stratégie militaire et l'administration modernes, tout en s'imprégnant de la culture de la cour russe. Il rentra au pays en 1909 en tant que Grand prince sur ordre du Tsar, et devint Émir seulement un an plus tard. Son premier décret interdit à ses ministres, fonctionnaires et collecteurs d'impôts d'accepter des pots-de-vin, ce qui conduisit les nombreux intellectuels progressistes du Jadid à le saluer comme le grand réformateur dont leur émirat avait désespérément besoin. Cet optimisme fut cependant de courte durée lorsque son second décret fut promulgué, envoyant plusieurs Jadids éminents en exil en Sibérie. Alim Khan était heureux d'éliminer l'ancienne bureaucratie, mais il savait bien qu'il n'y avait pas de place pour un dictateur tout-puissant et non élu dans les plans des réformateurs, et il provoqua et purgea ces mouches du coche tout au long de son règne.\n\nL'Émir se révéla être un opérateur politique avisé, bien que léthargique, pendant la Guerre civile russe. Il ne soutint ni les Rouges ni les Blancs jusqu'à ce que le vainqueur soit certain, et évita (de justesse) la révolution sur le plan intérieur grâce à un ensemble de réformes démocratiques et méritocratiques limitées. Au cours des années de paix qui ont suivi, l'Émir fit tout ce qui était en son pouvoir pour affaiblir et annuler ces concessions, avec le soutien constant du chef de la tribu Lokai, Ibrahim Bek, violemment conservateur, qu'il nomma Atalyk (régent) du royaume. Une fois sa base fondamentaliste assurée, ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'Alim Khan ne se sente suffisamment en sécurité pour tenter de soumettre ses sujets rebelles une bonne fois pour toutes.§!"

### Focus ###
 BUK_focus:9 "Arbre de Priorités de [BUK.GetName]"

 BUK_parade_the_lashkarya:9 "Défilé de la Lashkarya"
 BUK_parade_the_lashkarya_desc:9 "L''armée' permanente de Boukhara est, pour l'essentiel, un regroupement hétéroclite de divisions d'apparence grossière et d'armées fantômes, qui existent sur le papier mais n'ont pas de soldats, se contentant de verser de l'argent sur les comptes d'administrateurs et de commandants sans scrupules. Nous devrions montrer ces quelques unités qui sont l'exception - ces élites élégantes et brillantes de l'émirat."

 BUK_meet_with_cotton_barons:9 "Rencontrer les Barons du Coton"
 BUK_meet_with_cotton_barons_desc:9 "Loin des plafonds voûtés et des pierres grandioses de l'Arche de Boukhara, une petite maison européenne accueille la plupart des hommes les plus influents de l'émirat. Ces grands titans de l'industrie du coton se chamaillent et se disputent dans des salles enfumées, décidant à bien des égards du sort économique du royaume sur leurs bilans et leurs tables de commerce. Il est temps de leur rendre visite."

 BUK_reaffirm_emergency_taxes:9 "Réaffirmer les Taxes d'Urgence"
 BUK_reaffirm_emergency_taxes_desc:9 "Au plus fort de la Crise d'Asie centrale, nos ministres ont proposé une série de taxes d'urgence sur les marchandises, dans l'espoir qu'un choc sur le budget militaire conduirait à une armée plus moderne. Bien que les efforts de modernisation aient largement stagné, la nouvelle richesse a fait partie intégrante des opérations quotidiennes de notre gouvernement. La poursuite de ces taxes pour une année supplémentaire sera impopulaire, mais nécessaire."

 BUK_untangling_the_administration:9 "Démêler l'Administration"
 BUK_untangling_the_administration_desc:9 "Des centaines d'années de pourriture institutionnelle rongent notre gouvernement, étouffant l'efficacité de notre administration et nous rendant vulnérables à la corruption et à la mauvaise gestion. Les conseillers et les experts sont trop faibles et trop effacés pour remettre en cause ce statu quo, mais il en reste quelques-uns au sein de notre gouvernement qui comprennent que parfois, la meilleure façon de se débarrasser d'une infestation de rats est tout simplement de les écraser."

 BUK_shuffle_the_builders:9 "Remanier le Conseil des Bâtisseurs"
 BUK_shuffle_the_builders_desc:9 "Rares sont ceux qui se rendent à Boukhara sans prendre le temps de se délecter de la majesté de son architecture, mais plus rares encore sont ceux qui prétendent que les grandes œuvres de la ville sont tout sauf anciennes. Le Conseil des bâtisseurs était un groupement informel d'ouvriers qualifiés, réuni au plus bas de l'ère des réformes. Aujourd'hui, il n'est guère plus qu'une sangsue qui s'engraisse sur le dos du gouvernement."

 BUK_expand_the_cotton:9 "Acheter des Plantations de Coton en Faillite"
 BUK_expand_the_cotton_desc:9 "Bien qu'il y ait des terres fertiles dans tout notre royaume, nous n'en tirons que peu de revenus. Les investissements russes considérables dans les cultures de coton ont porté quelques fruits, mais avec l'incertitude des marchés mondiaux, nos honorables invités se démènent pour rembourser leurs créanciers. Le moment est venu d'acheter certaines de ces plantations marginales, même si cela risque de déplaire à nos alliés moscovites."

 BUK_silk_road_sisters:9 "Les Sœurs Jumelles de la Route de la Soie"
 BUK_silk_road_sisters_desc:9 "À l'époque où le commerce transcontinental passait par l'Asie centrale, Boukhara et Samarcande étaient les deux plus grands joyaux des steppes. Dans les années qui suivirent, Samarcande devint le centre de la domination islamique dans la région et le siège de nombreux souverains célèbres, d'Abu Muslim à Tamerlan lui-même. Nous devons accorder à cette ville le respect qu'elle mérite, en tant que partie autonome mais soumise de notre royaume."

 BUK_the_emirs_right_hand:9 "La Main Droite de l'Émir"
 BUK_the_emirs_right_hand_desc:9 "Depuis que la menace rouge a menacé de détrôner notre émir, la vieille rivalité entre le chef des Lokai, Ibrahim Bek, et Alim Khan s'est transformée en une alliance pragmatique contre ceux qui voudraient vendre Boukhara au diable. Commandant militaire éprouvé et musulman dévot, Ibrahim est un allié inestimable du trône, un rôle que nous préciserons en élevant la fonction d'Atalyk au-dessus de toutes les autres fonctions dans l'émirat."

 BUK_strengthen_the_militias:9 "Renforcer les Milices"
 BUK_strengthen_the_militias_desc:9 "Le cœur de notre armée a longtemps été constitué par les levées de paysans, rassemblées en temps de crise pour servir de chair à canon réticente et de soldats démotivés. Cependant, cela fait des années que nous n'avons pas recensé avec précision les hommes valides de notre royaume, ce qui signifie que certains des paysans les plus rusés pourraient éviter d'être enrôlés si un conflit devait éclater. Cette situation est inacceptable."

 BUK_reform_professional_army:9 "Réformer l'Armée Professionnelle"
 BUK_reform_professional_army_desc:9 "L'armée permanente de Boukhara, la "Lashkarya", n'est guère plus qu'une collection de gardes-frontières, mal équipée pour affronter une force plus puissante que des bandits démoralisés ou des paysans rebelles. De vastes réformes sont nécessaires pour amener l'armée royale aux normes modernes, en particulier face à la résistance croissante des membres les plus conservateurs de notre administration."

 BUK_expand_our_fortifications:9 "Étendre nos Fortifications"
 BUK_expand_our_fortifications_desc:9 "Depuis dix ans, notre frontière nord est menacée par le seigneur de la guerre Madamin Bek, avide des richesses de Samarcande. Si l'œil vigilant de nos protecteurs russes nous a permis de rester en sécurité jusqu'à présent, nous devons maintenant prendre les choses en main. Une série d'avant-postes le long de notre frontière septentrionale pourrait nous aider à contenir notre agressif voisin et nous donner le temps de mobiliser nos milices."

 BUK_refurbish_artillery:9 "Rénover l'Artillerie Ancienne"
 BUK_refurbish_artillery_desc:9 "La pauvreté favorise l'ingéniosité, et il existe peu d'endroits plus pauvres que Boukhara. Ce n'est pas parce qu'un canon a été utilisé pour disperser les tribus turkmènes en 1762 qu'il ne peut pas disperser les turkmènes d'aujourd'hui. Nous remettrons en état le matériel plus ancien afin d'équiper le plus grand nombre possible de nos unités d'une forme ou d'une autre de tir lourd, même s'il n'est pas du tout conforme aux normes modernes."

 BUK_reassess_our_military:9 "Revoir notre Position Militaire"
 BUK_reassess_our_military_desc:9 "Depuis des années, la position officielle de nos forces militaires est qu'elles ne doivent être que les auxiliaires de nos protecteurs russes. Alors que la situation en Europe s'échauffe et que le seigneur de guerre du Turkestan prend de l'assurance, nous devrons peut-être faire face à une nouvelle et effrayante réalité.

Cet afflux de technologies et d'investissements étrangers s'accompagne de la nécessité de faire appel à des esprits brillants venus de l'étranger. Après tout, le grand émir lui-même n'a-t-il pas étudié dans les salles enneigées de Saint-Pétersbourg ?"

Bien que nos patrons russes se soient plaints de cette ingérence étrangère, même eux n'ont pas pu contester les avantages d'une telle entreprise. Il est maintenant temps de récolter les fruits de cette mission en promouvant ces jeunes officiers à des postes de premier plan et en réformant notre Armée royale autour d'eux."

Tous les succès que nous avons remportés dans la modernisation de nos forces armées sont dus à la coopération et à l'expertise de nos conseillers russes, et si nous espérons faire de nouveaux progrès, nous aurons une fois de plus besoin du soutien de Moscovites aventureux et novateurs."

 BUK_support_of_the_clans:9 "Rein in the Clans"
 BUK_support_of_the_clans_desc:9 "Outside of the capital, our realm is ruled largely through a network of feudal patronage networks, with powerful clan leaders paying little more than lip service to the central government. While the last couple of decades has seen remarkable centralisation of the hinterlands, recent neglect has led several of our more independently minded Beys to suddenly forget their newfound obligations to the central government. We will need to remind them."

 BUK_restore_magok_i_attari_desc:9 "Originally a Zoroastrian temple in the heart of Bukhara, the Magok-i-Attari Mosque was built in the years immediately following the Arab conquest of the region. The complex has been renovated several times over the following millennium, and has held a storied past as the home of both Muslims and Bukhara's population of Jews throughout the centuries. We should restore it to its former glory."

 BUK_contacts_in_afghanistan:9 "Our Contacts in Afghanistan"
 BUK_contacts_in_afghanistan_desc:9 "Many of the Tajik and Uzbek tribal leaders in our nation have fostered ties across the border in Afghanistan. After all, in the hinterlands of our Emirate one's loyalties lie with local authorities far above that of Kabul or Bukhara. We must draw upon these cross-border connections for our benefit, drawing resources out of friendly chiefs to the south."

 BUK_honour_the_ulama:9 "Honour the Ulemma"
 BUK_honour_the_ulama_desc:9 "The Ulemma Jemyeti, or Board of Learned Men, is a council of Muslim leaders focused on maintaining the position of Islam and its clerics in Turkestan. Our commitment to Shari'a is absolute, and, regardless of Russian influence, the mullahs reign supreme in our society. With the godless socialists and their Jadid allies agitating against our Emir, the intervention of the Ulemma is needed."

 BUK_call_for_the_faithful:9 "Call for the Faithful"
 BUK_call_for_the_faithful_desc:9 "The foundation of our Emirate is our commitment and devotion to our faith, and while we take little stock in the opinions of the masses, it is the faithful who make up our most loyal subjects. We will need to galvanise this group of true believers against the poisonous words and treasonous actions of the godless and the misguided, or else these riotous mobs will tear apart our great Emirate."

 BUK_jadidism_jihad:9 "Jihad Against Jadidism"
 BUK_jadidism_jihad_desc:9 "When the survival of Islam in our realm is called into question, the Ulema are able to call for a “Gazavat” holy war of resistance, conscripting all able-bodied Muslim men into the service of our devoted Emir. Such a proclamation has not been made since the days of the Russian Revolution, yet our very religion is threatened by the heretical teachings of the Jadids and their allies."

 BUK_purge_reformers:9 "Purge the Remnant Reformers"
 BUK_purge_reformers_desc:9 "At the height of the reform era, the Young Bukharans forced our Emir to surrender much of his power to squabbling politicians and corrupt bureaucrats. In the years following, we have slowly clawed back control of the realm, weakening the Jadid controlled councils and giving us the opportunity to finally eliminate the fifth column which threatens to dismantle the emirate."

 BUK_manage_the_ministries:9 "Manage the Ministries"
 BUK_manage_the_ministries_desc:9 "The central government of Bukhara is made up of a complex assortment of officials, who often bicker over their overlapping responsibilities and powers. Recently, however, the government has truly devolved into a sort of diarchy, with ministers loyal to the Kushbeggi and administrators loyal to the Atalyk each carving away at any semblance of healthy governance. We must put these troublemakers in their place."

 BUK_strengthen_the_kushbeggi:9 "Empower the Kushbeggi"
 BUK_strengthen_the_kushbeggi_desc:9 "There is not a soul in Bukhara who does not see Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji as a puppet of the conservative mullahs, but there is a reason that this wise statesman has retained his post for more than a decade. He has repeatedly proven his loyalty to the Emir, and has served as a stalwart defence against the radicalism which creeps further and further into our nation. With our full support, he may continue in his dutiful administration."

 BUK_loosen_uzbekisation:9 "Loosen Uzbekisation"
 BUK_loosen_uzbekisation_desc:9 "Our Emir has learned much about the Russification efforts employed by the old Tsardom while studying in Saint-Petersburg, and in turn formulated a strategy to forcibly educate the Tajiks in Uzbek customs and language. This policy has done little aside from creating a generation of Tajik subjects who despise their Emir. By loosening this policy of forced assimilation, we can extend an olive leaf."

 BUK_appoint_a_new_chairman:9 "Empower the Majlis"
 BUK_appoint_a_new_chairman_desc:9 "In the years following the Civil War, Jadid elder Mirzo Abdulvohid Munzim dominated the domestic policy of the nation as Chairman of the Majlis, presiding over a decade of semi-constitutional rule. His death allowed Alim Khan to circumvent the reforms, but recent events have forced the Emir to once again allow the Council to meet, potentially ushering in a new era of Bukharan reformism."

 BUK_call_for_a_council:9 "Force a Meeting of the Moderates"
 BUK_call_for_a_council_desc:9 "In the aftermath of the Atalyk's gamble for control, the various oppositional factions within our court have gone right back to counter-productive squabbling, threatening to once again freeze our government. While the Kushbeggi and the Majlis may not like one another, they've already shown their ability to work together in a crisis. We will force them to do it again."

 BUK_strengthen_state_institutions:9 "Strengthen State Institutions"
 BUK_strengthen_state_institutions_desc:9 "The period of dual rule under the Atalyk and Kushbeggi have created confusion in all levels of governance, as administrators picked and choosed who to report to, to which government taxes should flow, and what rules of law to listen to. It is time to reassert clear hierarchies of power and strong institutions which the state can actually rely upon in times of need."

 BUK_central_asia_in_flames:9 "Enact Emergency Provisions"
 BUK_central_asia_in_flames_desc:9 "Through godless guile and violent insurrection, the socialists and their allies in Turkestan have destabilized our control of Samarkand, threatening the heart of our realm. With our government no longer held by the shackles of deadlock, we can move fast to reassert control over our borders and preempt further revolutionary activity."

 BUK_open_the_caches:9 "Open the Caches"
 BUK_open_the_caches_desc:9 "At the height of the Central Asian Crisis, Russian garrisons retreating from Tashkent and Ashgabat carried vast stocks of arms, hoping to prevent their capture by the Persians or Basmachi warlords. When the situation settled, these stocks of largely outdated armaments were stored away, forgotten by the vast and disorganized Empire they belonged to. The Russians may have abandoned these arms, but we will ensure they find their way to the battlefield!"

 BUK_the_last_stand:9 "The Last Stand for Bukhara"
 BUK_the_last_stand_desc:9 "Madamin Bek's dogs and Junaid Khan's bandits bear down on our capital, threatening to plunder and pillage their way through every alley and square until there is nothing left of our Emirate but a smouldering ruin. We will not turn and run, but rather hold fast, reinforcing the Karshin Gates and securing the vital bridges over the Amu Darya, Kashka Darya, and Zeravshan Rivers."

 BUK_reconstruction:9 "Reconstructing the Emirate"
 BUK_reconstruction_desc:9 "The battle for Samarkand has left our Emirate with deep scars, with a new generation touched by the brutality of war, our coffers depleted, and our faith in Russia shaken. Yet we stand now as we never have before. The rabble rousers in Tashkent called us the chained dogs of the kafir, but we showed them the depth of our resilience when we heated them on the battlefield."

 BUK_expand_the_beyliks:9 "Expand the Beylik System"
 BUK_expand_the_beyliks_desc:9 "Traditionally, the Emirate of Bukhara was divided into a number of Beyliks provinces, each ruled by an appointed governor. This foundational administrative system has served the Emirate well for centuries, and will be the framework for a new division of our realm into governorates, each led by a Bey whose true loyalties must lie more with the Emir than the lands they rule."

 BUK_okhrana:9 "Our Own Okhrana"
 BUK_okhrana_desc:9 "For too long, the control of our citizenry rested solely on the shoulders of our governors, who cultivated informal networks of informants and crudely crushed any sign of dissent. We must look north to the Russian model of surveillance, forming a purpose-built agency to monitor and combat revolutionary activity."

 BUK_restore_order_to_territories:9 "Restore Order to the Territories"
 BUK_restore_order_to_territories_desc:9 "The fighting in Samarkand and our borderlands proved one thing conclusively: while our control of Bukhara and its surroundings is complete, our ability to project power beyond that is hampered by poor lines of communication and transportation, and a moribund system of Governors and military districts. We must reorganise the military commands to match our recent reforms to the Beylik System."

 BUK_develop_heartland:9 "Develop the Heartland"
 BUK_develop_heartland_desc:9 "While it is tempting to cast our eyes far beyond the borders of our capital, we must remember that our home is Bukhara, the heart of the Emirate.

 BUK_draft_a_constitution:9 "Draft the Emir's Constitution"
 BUK_draft_a_constitution_desc:9 "The Emir has ruled for decades by decree, his powers held in check only by his advisors and commanders. The moderate Jadids have long clamored for the promulgation of a constitution and the establishment of a parliament, while the absolutists have increasingly adopted the notion of a constitution as a means to formalize the status-quo. With our victory in the War on the Steppes, we have the leeway to choose a path forward."

 BUK_deal_with_tajiks:9 "Dealing with the Tajiks"
 BUK_deal_with_tajiks_desc:9 "At the height of the crisis in Samarkand, the agitation of our rebellious Tajik subjects threatened to destabilize the entirety of our Emirate. For years, we have tried every possible approach towards dealing with the issue of these disloyal Tajiks, cutting deals and cutting off heads in even numbers. This indecision must end if we are ever going to stabilize the realm, and a clear policy towards the Tajiks must be drafted."

 BUK_feared_and_loved:9 "Feared and Loved"
 BUK_feared_and_loved_desc:9 "Years ago, the Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli stated that, "It is better to be feared than to be loved, if one cannot be both." There is no doubt in the minds of our subjects that the Emir is a figure to be feared. Even more importantly, there are many in his realm who see their leader as a true defender of conservatism, protecting the values of Islam against the threat of reform and revolution."

 BUK_new_islamic_renaissance:9 "A New Islamic Renaissance"
 BUK_new_islamic_renaissance_desc:9 "The rise of the Jadid reform movement among Uzbek and Tajik clergy has been disastrous to the culture and religion of our realm. These men have abandoned the very faith they claim expertise over, instead choosing to argue amongst themselves and scheme against the reign of a devout ruler. We will invest our resources into a new generation of scholars who can refute the heretical teachings of the kafir."

 BUK_push_our_claims:9 "Stretch our Wings"
 BUK_push_our_claims_desc:9 "For too long, we have been wholly cowed by our allegiance to apathetic overlords and the interests of foreign powers. It is time that we stretch our wings as a regional power, asserting our ourselves as an equal partner, rather than a weak backwater. We may even wish to once again look to our borders and reclaim what rightfully belongs to our realm."

# BUK_expand_conscription: "Call the Levies"
# BUK_expand_conscription_desc: "In times of crisis, the informal militias of our Emirate, the “Na-kary,” are called up to serve as the bulk of our armies. These militias must be called up to service to protect against Madamin Bek's invasion, even if their training is limited and their equipment outdated."

# BUK_call_the_tribes: "Call the Tribes"
# BUK_call_the_tribes_desc: "Most people across Central Asia hold little loyalty beyond their family and tribal affiliation, and it is the leaders of these groups which collectively hold power on the steppes. Without the support of the tribes, we cannot hope to truly rule over these lands. Our Emir shall call the headsmen to Bukhara, so that he may hear out their needs and desires, and convince them of his magnanimity."

# BUK_form_a_new_council_of_ministers: "Form a New Advisory"
# BUK_form_a_new_council_of_ministers_desc: "Ever since the disastrous March Reforms, Bukhara has been shackled by an advisory parliament, whose elected members serve as mouthpieces for the dissident and revolutionary elements of our state. Obviously, there is precious little common ground found between our learned Emir and these radicals. By forming a new Advisory, however, filled with men who share the Emir's vision for Turkestan, we can better rule our lands."

# BUK_expand_the_ark: "Rebuild the Ark"
# BUK_expand_the_ark_desc: "In legends, the Ark of Bukhara was constructed by the epic hero Siyavusha, who built a great palace within the bounds of a bull skin to win the hand of his love, the king's daughter. In reality, the fort at the heart of the city has been demolished and rebuilt countless times over hundreds of years. We must reinforce it, lest it be demolished again."

 BUK_raise_urban_militias:9 "Raise Urban Militias"
 BUK_raise_urban_militias_desc:9 "When the Emir was overthrown and a new democratic and socialist republic was declared, the vast majority of the tribal military and militia units abandoned our national cause, pledging themselves to local warlords or our enemies. While we will need to rely on our Russian allies, we can also move to equip urban workers with arms, organizing them into loose cadres so that they may defend their homes."

 BUK_promote_overlooked_merit:9 "Promote Overlooked Merit"
 BUK_promote_overlooked_merit_desc:9 "For centuries, caste systems, tribal arrangements, and hereditary stagnation has meant that thousands of bright and capable minds have been ignored in the favor of the witless relatives of corpulent Beys. We will promote a new generation of driven and bright leaders, not from the bloodlines of Ghengis but from the harshest factory lines and dingiest farming hamlets. They will succeed where the old blood has failed!"

 BUK_complete_the_purge:9 "Complete the Purge"
 BUK_complete_the_purge_desc:9 "The work of overturning centuries of ruthless authoritarian oppression, backwards brutality, and monarchical stagnation is neither pleasant nor easy. For every corrupt leech on the lifeblood of the peasantry we condemn to labor-reeducation, two reactionary parasites sneak under our gaze. Regardless, we must transition our frenetic programme of political cleansing with something a little more sustainable if we wish to stabilize the nation."

 BUK_form_a_provisional_governemnt:0 "Former un gouvernement provisoire"
 BUK_form_a_provisional_governemnt_desc:9 "To gain the legitimacy we so desperately need, we will need to be willing to reach across to our republican brethren, even if we fundamentally disagree with them on the future our young republic needs. We will use Comrade Khodjaev's connections within the Young Bukharan movement to invite some members into a nascent government body. While their contributions will be limited, they will serve as valuable symbols of our unity!"

 BUK_draft_political_officers:9 "Draft Political Officers"
 BUK_draft_political_officers_desc:9 "Our nation's military situation is marked by an unfortunate conundrum: those with significant military experience in the previous regime are politically unreliable, and those who are most ideologically committed unfortunately have little in the way of military experience. The best solution is to embed politically active officers into our units, so that our soldiers may learn more about the cause they are fighting for!"

 BUK_emergency_military_council:9 "Adopt 'War Socialism'"
 BUK_emergency_military_council_desc:9 "Trying to coordinate the various tribal and urban militias, former army units, and barely-better-than-bandits irregulars is a gargantuan task, and our lack of clear hierarchy has threatened to unravel the fabric of our military coordination. We will subordinate all of our units under an emergency military council, made up of a small number of relatively trusted officers. It is frightening to grant them these sweeping powers, but we have no other choice."

 BUK_awaken_the_proletariats:9 "Wake the Sleeping Proletariat"
 BUK_awaken_the_proletariats_desc:9 "The people of Bukhara have been shackled by the chains of feudal brutality for centuries, with any attempt to educate the proletariat of their struggle stamped out by the violence inherent to the old system. It is no surprise, then, that there is next to no ideological development among the people of Bukhara, even a great number of urban workers. We must make them understand that we are fighting for their freedom!"

 BUK_dawn_of_modern_turkestan_desc:9 "For more than a thousand years, the Central Asian tribes have been dominated by petty khans, violent autocrats, and foreign governors. Finally, our nation can step out of the darkness of royalist control, and into the light of the modern world! Through our blood, sweat, and tears, we will turn Turkestan into a glorious and modern republic!"

 BUK_sweeping_land_reform_desc:9 "The lands of Central Asia have great potential. While much of the region is harsh and fallow, there are areas which have great potential as fertile farming communities. Unfortunately for us, these lands are dominated by corpulent landowners who mismanage and squander the bountiful grounds granted to them by ancient Emirs. Unfortunately for these landowners, we are more than willing to expropriate these lands out from under their control."

 BUK_draft_a_republican_constitution_desc:9 "When Aleksandr Miller attempted to force a constitution through the halls of the Ark of Bukhara, he was rebuffed by the Emir, who was afraid of the ‘magical power' such a document would grant. The Emir was right about one thing, those powers granted by a constitution - checks and balances, fundamental citizen rights, procedures and institutions of government - do have a certain magic to them, a magic we hope dearly to utilise."

 BUK_implement_education_reforms:9 "Implement Education Reforms"
 BUK_implement_education_reforms_desc:9 "The Jadid progressive education reform campaign was one of the first true political movements in Central Asia, gathering the support of hundreds of leading intellectual figures and statesmen to action real and lasting reforms to the outmoded traditional madrasa education. Unlike our predecessors, who rewarded these brave and diligent pioneers with lashes, exile, and execution, we will support and fund these new modernisation plans!"

 BUK_hold_local_elections:9 "Hold Local Elections"
 BUK_hold_local_elections_desc:9 "One of the essential foundations of our republic's legitimacy is our government's relationship with the people of Central Asia. We are the defenders of the people's will, and it is through the implementation of local national elections that we will truly reflect the spirit of our citizenry. Of course, some restrictions will be necessary to safeguard the fundamental nature of our republic."

With our new national army empowered and reorganised, we finally have the tools to fully secure our nation by destroying these violent marauders and the dissents who protect them."

 BUK_promote_a_unified_language:9 "Promote a Unified Language"
 BUK_promote_a_unified_language_desc:9 "Chagatai Turkic was the shared language of our realm for centuries, but in the last two hundred or so years local dialects have diverged sharply from their now archaic origin. However, there is a cadre of brave intellectual thinkers who believe that, with the proper modernisation and implementation, we could once again forge a shared language, modelled on Chagatai but not beholden to some of its most difficult quirks."

 BUK_tear_down_the_folk_shrines:9 "Tear Down the Folk Shrines"
 BUK_tear_down_the_folk_shrines_desc:9 "The practice of Islam throughout Central Asia is tainted with local superstition, the divine truth corrupted by over a thousand years of local misinterpretation. We have established a network of local religious boards, meant to serve as the link between the government and the people, struggling to destroy the very unnecessary superstructures and incorrect interpretations of Islam."

 BUK_empower_the_national_army:9 "Reorganise the Republican Army"
 BUK_empower_the_national_army_desc:9 "Without a centralised, organised, and loyal army, our young republic does not stand a chance. Unlike our predecessors, we cannot rely on the support and command of local feudal chieftains and lords to supply us with soldiers and defend our government. Instead, we will need to build new institutions of military organisation from the ground up, gutting the atrophied officer corps of the Emirate and slashing and burning our way through its traditional structure."

 BUK_break_the_crowns:9 "Break the Crowns"
 BUK_break_the_crowns_desc:9 "While our people have been freed from the yoke of monarchical oppression, those living in foreign lands continue to suffer under the boot heel of sadistic and cruel monarchs, and the evil institutions which maintain their rule.

Ces dernières années, les rouages bien huilés de l'État se sont enrayés, l'émir Alim Khan ayant commencé à intervenir plus directement dans les affaires de ses ministres. Craignant le Majlis dominé par les Jadid, l'émir a laissé l'organe central du gouvernement sans dirigeant, remplissant les postes avec des béni-oui-oui et des loyalistes. Les réformistes craignent que la bureaucratie de l'État ne soit sur le point de s'effondrer complètement, tandis que les conservateurs critiquent le système administratif actuel, qu'ils accusent d'avoir été vidé de sa substance et ruiné par les réformistes."

Avec un Majlis apathique et sans chef et des subordonnés privilégiés de l'émir mal équipés pour faire face à la crise actuelle, les fonctions de base de la gouvernance se sont effondrées et notre bureaucratie s'est retrouvée désorganisée et confuse. Les réformistes ont dénoncé la situation actuelle comme étant le résultat d'un effort systématique pour défaire les réformes Miller, tandis que les conservateurs pointent du doigt la corruption et le gonflement du système administratif de l'émirat comme étant la cause de cette crise."

La majeure partie de notre force de combat est toujours constituée de levées glorifiées et de milices tribales, auxquelles on fait appel en temps de crise. L'armée permanente est prometteuse, mais elle a été lente à s'adapter aux équipements modernes et aux nouvelles tactiques.

 BUK_country_intro_content:9 "As the civil war raged in Russia, so too did the Young Bukharan movement - in March 1918, they attempted to wrestle control of the Emirate of Bukhara. They were soundly defeated;  the conservative Emir Mohammed Alim Khan attempted to hold his position of absolute power against the emboldened and radicalized movement, executing Red emissaries and clamping down on dissent within his domain. The protectorate was able to hold on, largely due to the Emir's support for the White cause. The pre-war arrangements and treaties were qiuckly reaffirmed, and the Emir was more than happy to browbeat his increasingly rebellious subjects with the support of his old Russian allies.\n\nWith the external Red threat eliminated, the Emir of Bukhara turned to the insidious radical movement within the city of Bukhara itself. Having executed a number of prominent reformists at the height of the Civil War, the tension between the conservative and autocratic rule of the Emir and the popular Young Bukharan movement threatened to rip the city apart. While Alim Khan initially prepared to burn out the cancer of liberalism in his realm through a violent purge, news of this planned massacre reached the ears of the newly formed SR/Kadet Government in Moscow, which heavily pressured the Emir to negotiate with the democratic opposition. With the threat of Russian intervention into the issue looming over the Emir, he immediately set to work drafting a reform package which would satisfy the Russians while ceding as little power as possible."
 BUK_country_intro_content_1:9 "The Emir opened an elected Communal Majlis which could send proposals to be reviewed by the Emir and his newly formed Council of Ministers, an appointed body of elder statesmen who would serve the Emir directly. As an additional olive branch to the Young Bukharans, the elder liberal Mirzo Abdulvohid Munzim was appointed as the first Chairman of the Council of Ministers. These reforms alleviated the Russian pressure on Bukhara, and gave the people a voice to propose legislation, though the Emir was loath to actually pass anything which crossed his desk. However, the Council of Ministers proved to be a dynamic group, and Munzim spearheaded a number of minor reforms to the Emirate, shaving away bureaucratic bloat and developing meritocratic institutions.\n\nWith the fallout of the 1929 coup and the ensuing chaos in Central Asia, the Emir made his move. Sensing an opportunity to expand his influence, Emir Alim Khan declared himself the “Protector of Samarkand,” intervening in the conflict. Seeing the devastation of Semirechye, the city accepted the armies of Bukhara into their gates, and the leader of the Emir's armies, the disciplined Ibrahim Bek, began to prepare for a siege. Worried of a Russian or Alash attack from the north, and recognizing a hardened foe to his south, Madamin called off the invasion of Samarkand and prepared to defend his newly won territories."
 BUK_country_intro_content_2:9 "After the conflict, the divide between the Emir and his Council of Ministers deepened, as the liberal Council expanded their powers and reach at the cost of his own. Just when it looked as though the Young Bukharans would be able to force Alim Khan into instituting a constitution and democratizing the state, the liberals suffered a major setback upon the death of their de-facto leader, the Chairman of the Council Mirzo Abdulvohid Munzim. Seeing this opportunity to turn back the tides of reform, Alim Khan refused to appoint a new Chairman, leaving the post vacant and the Council rudderless.\n\nInstead, the Emir has delegated increased powers to the conservative and vitriolically anti-Russian Atalyk Ibrahim Bek, though this arrangement is both unpopular with the people and increasingly inefficient. Not only are the Jadid reformers upset with his rule; many of his ministers see the newly empowered Atalyk as a rabid and unleashed dog who threatens to bring the Emirate into conflict with Russia. Alim Khan is not convinced by such arguments, however, and knows that as long as he occupies the Ark of Bukhara, the Emirate will stand as a steadfast ally to Moscow."

 bukhara.200.t:9 "The Bukharan Balancing Act"
 bukhara.200.d:9 "Bukhara is a nation divided along ideological, sectarian, and tribal lines, and Emir Sayid Alim Khan and his government has done precious to rectify this situation in the turbulent last decade. When the Russian Civil War first erupted, the Emir tried desperately to remain neutral, terrified that the coming war would lead to the end of his rule. Having rejected the reforms of his moderate Kushbeggi (Prime Minister) Mirza Nasrullah, sacking him in favour of the elders' darling Nizamiddin Urganji. While Urganji's steady hand and harsh reaction towards any socialist dissent was appreciated by the traditionalists and Russians alike, he was wholly unprepared to mend any of the deep ideological wounds scarring Bukhara. In the decades since, the stagnation of the Urganji led government has been lamented by the left, but it was changes from the political right which have finally uprooted the status quo.\n\nIbrahim Bek, a tribal leader from eastern Bukhara, who proved his loyalty and ability during the closing days of the Civil War, has been elevated by the Emir as the Atalyk - a nebulous position first held by the regents of the Golden Horde. With the vague limits of his newfound power, Ibrahim Bek has split the traditionalist faction between the Kushbeggi's old allies in the Ulemma, who view Russia as the only thing keeping the godless socialists from overthrowing the monarchical regime, and his new tribal and military elites who view Russia as just another tyrannical oppressor. While the Emir is personally deeply loyal to Russia, he views Ibrahim Bek as a valuable counterweight to Urganji's power, and seeks to further empower this wild man from the east should trouble with the reformers escalate. Of course, these reformers, mainly low-level bureaucrats and progressive Jadid intellectuals, see the rise of the Atalyk as an existential threat to their political influence and, more importantly, their lives. They will not see him solidify his grasp without a fight."
 bukhara.200.a:9 "They will all come to heel, one way or another!"

 bukhara.201.t:9 "Le Rempart Sud de Moscou"
 bukhara.201.d:9 "En comparaison avec les jours houleux du Coup d'État du Nouvel An, la dernière moitié de la décennie a été une période de paix et de stagnation, alors que toutes les parties pansent leurs plaies et espèrent se rétablir. L'Asie centrale est aujourd'hui une marmite au bord de l'ébullition, avec des intellectuels, des bandits, des révolutionnaires et des despotes qui cherchent tous à s'attaquer au statu quo. De l'autre côté des frontières, nos alliés russes tentent de comprendre le maelström, d'élaborer des plans et de calculer la logistique nécessaire pour rétablir l'ordre dans la région. Avec les rebelles khivans et les bandits turkestanais qui s'attaquent à nos frontières, ils ont du pain sur la planche. Ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'un conflit ouvert n'éclate à nouveau en Asie centrale, et pourtant les armées et les milices des États de la région sont universellement indisciplinées, sous-financées et à peine fonctionnelles. Il faudra beaucoup de travail pour transformer la populace et les bandits en véritables armées, et l'on ne peut que deviner comment chaque pays compte réformer la sienne.\n\nToutefois, une chose est certaine - §Rla paix de 1929 ne durera pas éternellement.§!"

 bukhara.202.t:9 "Black Monday Arrives in Bukhara"
 bukhara.202.d:9 "As much as we are loath to admit it, Bukhara is the economic playground of adventurous Russian and German industrialists, who long have seen our realm as an untapped source of cotton just waiting to be taken advantage of. For years, we reaped the rewards of this relationship, even as our economy became more and more dependent on hungry European markets to survive. With the recent economic collapse in Berlin and Moscow, the other shoe has dropped. Bales of cotton rot at market warehouses and train depots, while foreign agents and speculators flee in droves as companies fold and panic sets in. As the dust settles, we will be forced to pick up the pieces and salvage what we can, while preparing for the recovery of global markets so that we can resume making goldmarks and rubles hand over foot."
 bukhara.202.a:0 "Oh non!"

 bukhara.203.t:9 "Emergency Meeting of the Ministers"
 bukhara.203.d:9 "Following the devastation of the Black Monday crash, the Emir and his Kushbeggi have called for a series of meetings with the whole of the Council of Ministers, aimed at tightening our belts and recovering from the economic downturn. There has been little common ground found, as individual ministers care more about supporting the plans proposed by their patrons, rather than compromising and determining what is the best course of action. The Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji has pushed for the forced retirement of some of the more expensive military toys and the bigwigs who pushed for their adoption. He believes that while the Emir is unlikely to support a military cut-back, temporary setbacks and potential emergencies could be absorbed by closer coordination with Russia, while giving us more revenue to inject into the free-falling economy.\n\nHe is fervently opposed by the Atalyk and his military allies, who have instead proposed that a fierce campaign against government corruption would be adequate to regain the fiscal initiative, while maintaining the power of the military to defend against increasingly aggressive posturing by our neighbours. Of course, even he understands that money to recover the economy will not simply sprout out of the ground, but he is fervent in his arguments against relying further on Russian aid. Instead, he believes that investment into the military will create jobs for the jobless, while beefing up the Emir's ability to enforce his taxes and cow the corrupt into compliance.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have suggested that neither faction of the Council of Ministers has a viable plan to recover the Emirate. Instead, their patron ministers have proposed vesting an 'independent' committee of technocrats and experts with sweeping powers to reform the Bukharan economy. Of course, most of such technocrats would be Russian, a fact which is hard for most Bukharans, including the Emir, to swallow."
 bukhara.203.a:9 "We must bulk up our military!"
 bukhara.203.b:9 "Cut red tape and tighten our belt."
 bukhara.203.c:9 "Turn to the Russian advisory."

 bukhara.204.t:9 "Assassination of Mirza Nasrullah"
 bukhara.204.d:9 "In the days leading up to the declaration of the Tashkent Soviet and the entry of Central Asia into the maelstrom of the Civil War, Kushbeggi Mirza Nasrullah worked closely with Russian agent Aleksandr Miller to draft a series of liberal reforms to keep the leftists of the Emirate pacified and maintain the stability of the realm. However, Nasrullah would not be successful in selling the reform package, called the April Reforms, to the Emir, and would ultimately be undone by his expenditure of political capital into the reform project, losing the support of the Emir and the Russians before being unceremoniously sacked in favour of Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji. While the Russians would come to regret their abandonment of Nasrullah, especially as they were forced to work with Urganji while attempting to revive his dead proposals in 1921, the Emir has more or less fully forgotten about this elder statesman. In the last five years, Nasrullah returned from a long political exile in the eastern Beyliks to enter the government as the Shahwal, or foreign minister, mainly on the back of Russian support. In this position, he continued to distinguish himself as a flexible and reasonable leader, creating compromise coalitions between the Russians and reformists to force through vitally important trade and diplomatic reforms in the Emirate.\n\nHowever, in the great 'game' of influence between the Kushbeggi and his traditionalists, the Atalyk, the Russians, and the reformists, no piece is safe from the danger of their service. Directly following a government feast, Mirza Nasrullah suddenly came down sick and then passed in the night, before being rapidly spirited away into a grave by government officials. No one has been able to determine who ordered his overnight internment, as there are many, especially among the Russians and reformists, who believe that Nasrullah was poisoned by his enemies - either the Kushbeggi or the Atalyk are likely suspects. Some have gone as far as to quietly implicate the Emir in this supposed assassination, whispers which grow louder the longer that Alim Khan remains silent on the issue and his poisoner remains at large."
 bukhara.204.a:9 "Maybe it was just the stress of his work?"

 bukhara.205.t:9 "Samarkand Notables Request Aid"
 bukhara.205.d:9 "With the economic depression wrecking every strata and region of our economy, there is little opportunity to hear the individual complaints of subjects against the backdrop wail of a failing state. However, there are some individuals who are often able to make their voices heard, due to their sweeping localised importance or influence, or because of their ability to reach the ear of the Emir. In Samarkand, the Bukharan Emirate was only able to secure a semblance of authority over the city and its surroundings with the tacit support of the council of city leaders who took power during the Tashkent Crisis.\n\nThese same leaders have now come to us, requesting that we provide them with aid and assistance to help their city recover from the economic collapse. The truth is that such a proposition is daunting - while Bukhara is the capital of the Emirate, Samarkand is a more developed city, and in a perfectly fair world it would be Bukhara turning to her stronger neighbour for help. However, this also provides us with the perfect opportunity to strengthen our ties with the Samarkand, and to cut down their independence somewhat. After all, we are still technically nothing more than the 'protectors' of Samarkand, and our support now would go a long way towards shifting that relationship to something more committed."
 bukhara.205.a:9 "I suppose we will try our best!"

 bukhara.206.t:9 "The Atalyk Demands Action"
 bukhara.206.d:9 "As tensions rise in Central Asia, especially between our nation and the bandit fiefdom of the trumped up tramp Madamin Bek, more and more voices have begun clamouring for a committed push by our government to properly equip and prepare a fighting force which could hold its own against Turkestani, Persian, or Afghani prodding. The foremost voice in this camp has been the Atalyk, who has pushed hard for reforms to our militias, army, and quartermasters.\n\nOf course, most of these proposed changes just so happen to place more power into the hands of the Atalyk and his allies, but he is not alone in his sense of urgency and low opinion of our current prospects. The Russians have also begun prodding the Emir, hoping that with tensions rising in the west, they can devote less attention to our region by relying more on a capable autonomous Bukharan military. While there is little friendship or coordination between the Russians and Atalyk, their voices combined have begun to put considerable pressure on the Emir and his Kushbeggi."
 bukhara.206.a:9 "I suppose we will try our best!"

 bukhara.207.t.normal:9 "The Reformists Demand Reform"
 bukhara.207.t.complete:9 "Reformists Commend our Reforms"
 bukhara.207.d.normal:9 "The Communal Council, the democratic body of advisors to the Emir formed in the April Reforms, is, broadly speaking, a declawed political body. Already extremely limited in their powers by the Emir's amendments to the reforms, the death of their tireless leader Mirzo Abdulvahid Munzim marked the end of their relevance, as the Emir took advantage of the power vacuum to bar the formation of a new body - placing ever increasing control over the state in the hands of the illiberal Atalyk. While they are no longer formal members of the government administration, however, the former councillors are prominent political figures who together form the informal reformist faction of the bureaucracy, and the loose political alliance / secret society, the Young Bukharans.\n\nWhat the reformists lack in actual political clout, they make up in their vast array of connections throughout our populace and administration. They have begun ramping up their efforts to force through serious institutional reform by exerting pressure through criticism, carefully framed to get past our censors, disseminated widely through their newspapers and by word of mouth. While we can always just ignore these gadflies, it is clear that they expect action from us, and will be disappointed if we simply sit on our hands."

While they are no longer formal members of the government administration, however, the former councillors are prominent political figures who together form the informal reformist faction of the bureaucracy, and the loose political alliance / secret society, the Young Bukharans.\n\nWhile these reformists rarely congratulate our government, our recent efforts to reform the central bureaucracy of the Emirate has caught the eye of many of the leading figures in their movement. The liberal news media, often marked by its double-speak, where criticisms are hidden behind glowing words of support for the Emir, has genuinely expressed their interest and support for the recent efforts to overhaul and streamline the bloated bureaucracy."
 bukhara.207.a:9 "Try not to ignore them."
 bukhara.207.b:0 " Bien !"

 bukhara.208.t:9 "Miller Meets with Mansurov"
 bukhara.208.d:9 "As much as the Emir likes to imagine that his advisor Aleksandr Miller is his loyal subordinate, the truth is that he has little actual control over the Russian agent at the heart of Moscow's informal control over the Emirate. Over his prolific career as Russia's man in Bukhara, Miller has proven himself an incredibly savvy politician, making himself irreplaceable for the Russian President and Bukharan Emir alike. More than anything else, Miller is pragmatic - he supported Bukharan neutrality at the height of the Civil War, quashed tentative Russian plans to dethrone the Emir in the immediate aftermath of the Tashkent Crisis, and helped to shepherd the autonomist wing of the Young Bukharan society through the rising nationalist spirit of the last decade.\n\nIt was this last role which now propels Miller into the home of wealthy Bukharan progressive leader Muhiddin Mansurov, a leading figure within the Young Bukharan movement. Miller is no stranger to backroom deals with the democratic opposition in the city, it was his negotiations with them throughout the Civil War which averted a Republican revolution, and he worked closely with liberal figures to draft the reforms he proposed in the aftermath. While officially their rendezvous is nothing more than a social visit between two of Bukhara's most influential men, rumours have begun swirling about the clandestine topics of their dinner conversation. The leading story is that Mansurov invited Miller into his home for the strict purpose of convincing him that the Emir is holding Bukhara back from being a productive and efficient ally of Russia, and that a republic led by the Young Bukharans would better serve the interests of Moscow should they be allowed to take power. Supposedly, Mansurov even laid out a potential plan wherein his allies could isolate and eliminate the Emir's most rabid anti-Russian allies so long as they had assistance and assurances from Moscow.\n\nThese rumours end unanimously with the claim that Miller responded to these plans by..."
 bukhara.208.a:9 "...storming out angrily."
 bukhara.208.b:9 "...listening intently."

 bukhara.209.t:9 "Poor Quality Uniforms"
 bukhara.209.d:9 "In many ways, the prestige of a kingdom is its most valuable currency. When the trappings of the monarchy are lacking, it is only a matter of time before subjects start to question the righteousness of their station. Nowhere is this more important than in the ranks of the Emirate's armies, whose soldiers are dressed in a motley hodge-podge of uniforms. In the past few years, attempts have been made to unify the dress of our soldiers, but each attempt has been stymied by syphoned resources and mixed priorities.\n\nA recent parade, meant to celebrate the anniversary of our wonderful Emir's birthday and rise to his position as ruler of Bukhara, ended in embarrassment, as we were unable to find suitably well dressed men to supplement the ranks, leaving the parade a display of our failures.This disaster  has once again brought this issue to the forefront among a number of our military leaders, who have requested that we pursue a concerted effort to produce a single universal Bukharan uniform of acceptable quality, at least for those men expected to march in annual holiday parades!"
 bukhara.209.a:9 "Replace these rags!"
 bukhara.209.b:9 "Looks are not everything..."

 bukhara.210.t:9 "Merchants Beset by Bandits"
 bukhara.210.d:9 "While the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand are well guarded by local militias and the Emir's soldiers, the Emirate's countryside remains a mostly lawless land. Local tribes do their best to maintain peace among their own, but no one polices the trading roads which serve as the foundation of our economy. While our patchwork of governors and tribal leaders have managed to keep the wheels of commerce spinning, albeit slowly, some merchant families have come directly to the Ark, seeking our help. According to them, gangs of bandits have secured control over the southern passes between Qarshi and Samarkand, strangling trade in the region. While our forces would be more than able to secure these passes, we would have to pull away our men from other posts, potentially leaving us vulnerable elsewhere.

Victory against Turkestan, Khiva, the Kazakhs, and our own rebellious citizens was far from assured. The conflict pushed our military and government to their absolute limits, threatening to undo any and all of the reforms we made in the last couple of years. The unfortunate truth is that we must thank the Russians for our deliverance - it was their overwhelming military force which crushed our enemies and saved our nation. The truth is harder to swallow than convenient lies, however, and even now town criers and city newspapers tell grandiose tales of Bukharan bravery on the battlefield."

 bukhara.701.t:9 "Game Pieces in the Great Game"
 bukhara.701.d:9 "A century ago, the steppes of Central Asia were a part of the Great Game played between the great powers of Britain and Russia, who diplomatically duelled over control of the regions between the Russian heartland and British India for decades. The legacy was seen even into the maelstrom of the Civil War, where British soldiers intervened to defend White Ashgabat, laying the groundwork for its return to Iranian control. While the Great Game is all but over (as one of the players withdrew), the Great Powers control to hold the reins over our homeland. Even today, our realm is little more than one of many pieces on Moscow's game board, and we must bend to the will and whims of our puppet masters. Russia may have saved our realm from Turkestani and Khivan aggression, but the question remains as to what the next step may be. While we are hopeful that Moscow will choose to grant control of the newly pacified territories to us as a responsible partner, the air is thick with rumours that, burnt by repeated native disloyalty, the Russians are preparing to annex the entire region. Were they to move forward with such a betrayal, there is little we could do to resist them, with our forces entirely exhausted by the recent conflict and  their sweeping control over our administration.\n\nHowever, we have one trick up our sleeve to help sway the military and political leaders of Russia to our cause. We could attempt to whip up support among the resident military advisors and business leaders in Bukhara, sending them north to make a case for a new, Bukharan led, chapter in Central Asian history. If these leaders are pleased with our governance and content with the efficiency of a ‘native led' Central Asian state, they may be able to convince the Russians that we should be granted dominion over the region. However, if the local agents of Russian control are displeased with our governance, we will have no control over the decisions made in Moscow, decisions which will have sweeping effects on our realm."

Traditionally, we ruled Central Asia through a mixture of direct military governments (in Transcaspia and Russian Turkestan) and client kingdoms (in Khiva and Bukhara), a convoluted system which often proved more trouble than it was worth. In recent years, our puppet allies have proven themselves to be dubiously loyal and questionably competent, leading many to promote a more hands on approach to administering this rebellious region. However, others have advocated stridently for the creation of a unified and ‘independent' Turkic state in the region, claiming that it was the division of the region which allowed for rebellion to fester, and cautioning that the costs of administering Central Asia would far outweigh any gains we could glean from direct control of the region. With information about the region, the disposition of our allies, and the efficiency of our administration murky, we have come to rely heavily on the advice of the Emirate's Russian advisors, who have debriefed us on the various goings-on in the capital, along with many wanted (and unwanted) recommendations about how to proceed.\n\nHowever, our men on the ground have been mixed in their recommendations, with many promoting the Emir as a close ally of our regime, others advocating for the creation of a new, Republican, government to unify the region, while others still clamour for the annexation of the Emirate in our lands proper and the reorganisation of Central Asia into a manageable Russian realm. The maintenance of the Emir as a figurehead leader of a new Central Asian realm would likely go a long way towards keeping the peace in the region, and the protection of an Islamic monarchy could prove to be a valuable propaganda piece if we wish to court some Middle Eastern leaders. On the other hand, the Emir has proven himself to be an obstruction to the modernization of his realm, and there is significant public demand for a native-led republican government, especially among the Turkic intelligentsia. Of course, the simplest course would be to simply annex the lands so that their administration can be approached holistically. Then again, taking this course would likely provoke the ire of the native population. Without a clear direction from the experts in Bukhara, it is truly the government's choice to make."

These two positions have been muddled by a great number of our administrators who are wholly apathetic to the future government of the region. They argue that neither a republic or the Emirate is the pragmatic no-brainer: the maintenance of the Emir as a figurehead leader of a new Central Asian realm would likely go a long way towards keeping the peace in the region, and the protection of an Islamic monarchy could prove to be a valuable propaganda piece if we wish to court some Middle Eastern leaders.

However, as the days rolled on, the whispers and rumours from Moscow slowed to a trickle, and the Russians within our administration grew increasingly silent, hovering in small groups, discussing fervently in the corners, and going silent in the presence of our own agents and administrators. One does not need to be a genius to figure out what is occurring - from the first days of our victory there have been warning signs that, despite our loyalty, the Russians have decided that the whole of Central Asia would need to be ruled as a part of Russia proper. The recent changes in the air have all but confirmed our worst fears, and the growing number of Russian soldiers flowing into our realm “for the maintenance of the peace and the elimination of the lingering Basmachi insurgents” betray the violent aims of Moscow.Increasingly isolated, the Emir has little choice but to acquiesce to Moscow's whims - and with the recent receipt of a letter requesting his presence in the Russian capital, it appears his time in the Ark has run its course."

Today, such progress was put on full display, as the Bukharan army units, veterans of countless battles across Central Asia, marched through the city like consummate professionals. Of course, this illusion of tranquillity was broken when a bystander began agitating for some form of civilian protest - but calm was restored quickly with his untimely demise at the hands of a proud Bukharan dragoon's steed. With the dust settling, it appears the time has come for the Emir to forge a new nation - an Emirate of all Turkestan!

In the case of Bukhara, just about every man remaining on the inside was at least amenable to the Russian plot to overthrow the Emir and install a new caretaker republican government. When the order was given, Russian soldiers and some key native military officers stormed the Ark looking to capture Ibrahim Bek. The wild Uzbek chieftain did not intend to go quietly, and a brief and violent confrontation within the fortress claimed the lives of about thirty men, Ibrahim included. Immediately the plotters moved to install a new government, pulling Jadid leaders, moderate military figures, and minor nobles into the fortress. The Emir had betrayed the realm to Germany, they were informed, and was going to be placed under house arrest upon his arrival in Moscow. Bukhara, and Central Asia as a whole, would be reformed into a new republic, to avoid the dangers of a disloyal Emir from ever again selling our lands to foreign rulers.\n\nThe Russians have scrambled to find figures willing to take part in a new government. While the majority of the bureaucracy cares little for the nuances of politics, it is considerably more difficult to find a figure willing to be a figurehead for this new regime. Many are wary that the public's opinion will be stridently against a new president, while others are philosophically opposed to the idea of leading any sort of ‘puppet' administration. However, with the aid of some loyal ideologues and after a mixture of threats and promises, the increasingly worried Russian agents were able to convince eminent Jadid leader Mahmudkhodja Behbudiy to take up the republican mantle as a new caretaker president.

Most factions and forces within the old Emirate have pledged themselves to our new allied government under the caretaker leadership of the well regarded Jadid progressive Mahmudkhodja Behbudiy. While Behbudiy is free-spirited and unlikely to fully bend to our directives, he will have to rely on our agents to support his regime, and his goal of modernising the region broadly align with our own. If he proves to be too slippery, we could simply call for elections in the new Republic of Turkestan to bring a new, more pliable native into power. As it stands, we have gained a valuable buffer state and erstwhile ally in the south, with precious little expenditure of resources and rubles on our part. Of course, only time will tell whether this puppet state proves to be more trouble than it is worth, but in the meantime we should simply reap the rewards of a coup-well-plotted."

The Russians themselves, however, have made exceptional progress in their goals to leverage control over the republic, fostering support in a small band of radical republican reformists, who see Moscow as a model of modernism which Turkestan would do well to replicate. Abdurauf Fitrat, in part coloured by his experiences with the Ottoman Young Turk movement, has become a lighthouse for those feeling that Behbudiy and the Jadid old guard are too moderate, and a number of young proteges have found themselves rapidly elevated by tacit Russian support, securing several cabinet positions and vital bureaucratic positions for this new clique of new nationalists. Of course, the progressive and moderate Jadids have pushed back against this new galvanised movement, claiming that they represent Russian imperial intervention into the republic's governance. As various posts are filled by Russian agents with ‘ideologically loyal' natives, a government within the government has grown stronger and stronger - creating a diarchy between Russian backed junior officers and the various old-guard idealists they nominally report to. To their credit, these two factions are united by many of their goals and their shared experiences fighting against the oppression of the Emir, leading to many opportunities for genteel ideological debate and bipartisan reform efforts."

Many of the Jadids who availed themselves to the Emir's rule, hoping to enact reform under his thumb, have found themselves in a tricky situation, as their more radical brethren leverage their anti-monarchical chops. Behbudiy has increasingly found himself as the defender of these ‘old guard' liberals, while more radical factions have coalesced under the leadership of famed progressive leader Abdurauf Fitrat. While some worry that these growing pains are the precursors to dangerous factional division within the Young Turkestanis, most recognize that there are enough compromise focused figures, Behbudiy and Fitrat included, that the Party will remain united in the coming years.

With Ibrahim Bek's newly elevated role as the Atalyk of the Emirate, he has attempted to wrestle control of the Lashkarya standing army units away from Russian observers and trainers, to little success. However, the recent decision to parade these units has become yet another battleground for these two competing camps within the Bukharan military apparatus, leaving the Russian-leaning Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji to once again attempt to convince the Emir to rein in his favourite attack dog. Ibrahim Bek has demanded that no Russian national should march in the coming parade, nor should any Russians be seated anywhere near the Emir as he watches this display of national power. Of course, the Kushbeggi has cautioned that such an action would be a serious snub against our closest allies, and that additionally there may be trouble divesting our less competent units from their trained Russian officers - after all, we do not want anyone to start marching in the wrong direction."

Of course, his own friends and family who have become outrageously wealthy since his elevation as Kushbeggi are just lucky - there is no way that the Emir's most trusted advisor could be corrupt.\n\nMuch to Urganji's relief, Ibrahim Bek has recently focused his attention squarely upon the loose alliance of reform minded bureaucrats and their benefactors among the Young Bukharan movement, merchants, and Russians. The Kushbeggi will need to make a decision: opening the door for Ibrahim Bek to run amok in the balance sheets and personal coffers of the reformists may sate the Atalyk's thirst for blood and justice, and could save those close to him from similar focus.\n\nHowever, once the door is open, it is unlikely that Ibrahim Bek will be satisfied to root out only a few sticky-fingered bureaucrats. It may be a better idea to simply demand that the Kushbeggi and his office take control of these most recent investigations into corruption, allowing Urganji to keep the accusations relatively contained."

In this case, the Atalyk is silent, pouting that we have ignored the army in favour of saving the economy, while the liberals gripe about the dangers of technocratic influence in the state. Of course, if one reads between the lines it becomes clear that this is little more than a smoke screen to legitimize the personal grievances of a cadre of native 'economists' who believe that their vacations studying in Berlin, Petrograd, and Istanbul give them the right to dictate the recovery of the realm.

Instead, it is likely that they will poison the ears of the rank and file and complain to Ibrahim Bek, whose hatred of the Kushbeggi and the financial officers is fertile ground for the sad tales of the old windbags.

 bukhara.1007.d:9 "The Lokai are the third largest tribe of Uzbeks in eastern Bukhara, a collection of small family clans which have relentlessly fought to secure a position of power and prominence in the Emirate. On the way, they managed to make enemies of their neighbours and the late Emir, developing a reputation as reckless and wild troublemakers who would do anything to increase their power and secure their position. For a brief moment, it appeared that the Emir would move to crush the Lokai and put down these troublemakers, but the violence of the Russian Civil War made the fiercely fundamentalist Lokai tribesmen a much sought after commodity.\n\nIn the years following, the Lokai chieftain found the ear of the young Emir, becoming a leading advisor and military figure before recently being elevated into the position of Atalyk of the Emirate, potentially the highest office in the realm. Since then, the Lokai clans have run wild over their neighbours, pushing the boundaries of tradition and ignoring unfavorable rulings from local Qazis. The aggrieved tribal leaders have trickled into the capital, seeking the ear of the Kushbeggi and the Emir to settle a number of their more minor complaints. They have gathered together, promising significant contributions from their brethren to the national cause should the Emir lease his dog, but his majesty is in no rush to chastise Ibrahim Bek, and it would take serious prodding from the Kushbeggi and others to force him to hear out these beleaguered elders."

 bukhara.1008.d:9 "Traditionally, the power to grant seals of office is a significant boon, one which gives said organ of government sweeping control over the makeup of the office. In the case of the Qazis, the magistrates or judges of our nation's sharia courts, who also serve as mediators, guardians of orphans, teachers, and supervisors of public works, the seals of office were traditionally granted by the Emir himself, through his ministers and with the guidance of the Ulemma. Aleksandr Miller's reforms, brought into the realm through the April Manifesto, called for a fundamental reform of the Qazi system, allowing some Qazi judges to be elected by local councils, and granted the Communal Majlis the right to distribute the seals of office to these elected judges.\n\nWith the de-facto shuttering of the Majlis following the death of Mirzo Abdulvahid Munzim, the practice of electing Qazis has all but ceased, as there is no body to distribute these figures' seals. Regardless, there are still a number of currently practising judges who were elected in the early days of the reforms, who often interpret fiqh in a more liberal light than the conservative Ulemma, often invoking tribal law, sufi mysticism, and local practices when crafting their judgments. The Ulemma has pushed hard for us to revoke the seals of a number of the most heterodox Qazi judges, though there is little legal precedent to do so."

In recent years the positions have more or less been 'sold' to wealthy benefactors of the crown, with the most recent pair being a couple of prominent Uzbek merchants who have used their newfound positions, bought with opulent gifts to the Emir, as a means of rewarding their business partners in the textile trade. While their corruption is self-evident, these men have friends throughout the Emirate, among the bureaucrats, nobility, and especially the now silent Majlis, where many of their fellow merchants clamor for the dismantlement of our divine absolutism. Eliminating them may prove unpopular, but the Emir could be easily convinced of the benefits once he sees what they cost the coffers each year."

 bukhara.1010.d:9 "The Mir Akhor, or Master of the Horse, is a position of great honor in the Emirate, even as modern times call into question the modern role of the most noble of creatures in warfare. The modern role has been modelled in part after that of the Russian Konyushy, with similar responsibilities over the Emir's stables and the breeding of military steeds. The central treasury awards this position with significant sums of gold to purchase and outfit the Emir's horse with harnesses, horse armor, and to procure breeding studs, meaning that the role has become lucrative as well as honorable for more unscrupulous appointees. The current Mir Akhor is a former Beylik from one of the eastern Uzbek tribes, well respected by the traditionalists and the Emir, but uncontestedly unfit for his role. Under his tenure, the stables have fallen into disrepair, leading to the Kushbeggi to move for his replacement.\n\nThe Qaraulbegi, on the other hand, is quite competent, but unfortunately close with the Atalyk Ibrahim Bek. While the Kushbeggi may personally desire his removal, there is little evidence to bring to the Emir of his incompetence, and little chance that Alim Khan would risk upsetting his courtly favourite to remove him."

 bukhara.1011.d:9 "The Mirzabashi, or Chief Secretary, is a vital element of our day to day governance. With their hand in all levels of government, and coordination with the various Ministers, the Russian Agent Aleksandr Miller, and even the Atalyk, the Mirzabashi has a unique position to affect government policy. While our current Mirzabashi is certainly effective, he is increasingly seen as a pawn of Aleksandr Miller and his team of Russian advisors, who are worryingly involved in the maintenance of our administration. Some of our spies have seen him meeting with the Russians outside of the bounds of the Ark, potentially scheming for the removal of the Emir or his most loyal Kushbeggi, and his replacement with a more pliable figure to Moscow. Already, Miller has moved to remove Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji in the years following the conclusion of the Russian Civil War, and there is no love lost between the two men. By creating some creative proof of the Mirzabashi's involvement in a conspiracy, and then disseminating this evidence to the Emir, we would be justified in removing him, but it is likely that the Russians themselves would see through this ruse, potentially spoiling whatever working relationship we have built with them."

 bukhara.1012.t:9 "Uncovering the Atalyk's Conspiracy"
 bukhara.1012.d:9 "Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji is no friend to liberalism, socialism, progressivism, or any '-isms' really. He is much more focused on piety, tradition, and the maintenance of virtue. Of course, it was not his extensive knowledge of dogma which saw him appointed by the Emir as his chief minister in 1917, it was his palatability to the Russians and his supposed lethargy which carried him up the ladder. In the decades following his elevation, Urganji has spent the majority of his life fighting against the forces of reform and radicalism, repeatedly outmanoeuvring the Communal Majlis to thwart their attempts to change the fundamental foundations of our Emirate.\n\nEven still, strange times make for strange bedfellows, and the dramatic rise of the violent and zealous Uzbek tribesman Ibrahim Bek to the nebulously powerful role of Atalyk has threatened to destroy Urganji's carefully crafted and tenuously balanced machine of state. Instead of declawing the Majlis and pitting the factional left against one-another, Ibrahim Bek has 'solved' the democratic problem with extreme violence and a complete disregard for the realm's tradition, forcing the once rudderless and squabbling reformists to close ranks and steel their resolve against the Emir's right hand.\n\nAs the democratic opposition has radicalised, so too has the Atalyk. In fact, the Kushbeggi has recently uncovered a plot by Ibrahim Bek to provoke a 'contained' revolution in the capital to justify a sweeping purge of the Young Bukharans and their allies. This plan is wildly dangerous - what if the revolutionaries get out of hand? What will Ibrahim Bek do once the streets of Bukhara run red with blood? The Kushbeggi will have to decide where he stands: he could gather the liberal opposition together and present a comprehensive case against the Atalyk to the Emir, detailing Ibrahim Bek's dangerous attitude and multitudinous overreach and demanding that he be stripped of some of his more sweeping informal powers. Of course, he could instead try his hand at joining the Atalyk's conspiracy. After all, the Atalyk is the Emir's favoured, and there is no guarantee that  a petition to him will lead to any action. While Ibrahim Bek will certainly demand that the Kushbeggi fully subordinate himself in the post-purge administration and allying with him will cede control of the state to a ravenous warlord, it may just be Urganji's best chance to survive."

 bukhara.1013.t:9 "A New Chairman of the Majlis"
 bukhara.1013.d:9 "For half a decade, the Emir has used the vacancy left by the death of the late great Mirzo Abdulvahid Munzim to hamstring the Emirate's young and largely advisory legislature. However, with the recent conflict between the Atalyk and Kushbeggi settling in the favor of the liberal opposition, the Emir is all but forced by popular opinion and the prodding of his Russian advisors to bring the liberals back into the fold. To do this, he has once again called for the Majlis to meet, promising them that he will approve of whoever they vote in as Chairman.\n\nWithin the liberal camp, the Young Bukharans have whipped into a frenzy of action as various party officials clamour to secure a role as the new face of the re-opened Majlis. In the front is old guard Jadid education reformer and writer Munavvar Qori, whose long tenure of service within Munzim's inner circle affords a degree of legitimacy, and whose skill in oration and text is renowned.\n\nHis primary opposition has come from Muhiddin Mansurov, one of the wealthiest men in Bukhara. Without his monetary support, the Young Bukharan movement would have long since petered out, and his role as the primary editor of the well-known newspaper “The Sun” has given him an outsized voice while the liberals were out of government. Unfortunately for Mansurov, his Tajik ancestry worries many who think that the Emir would never allow a non-Uzbek to take on a position of such prominence.\n\nOf course, there is also the dark horse candidate, the old, wise, and largely apolitical Tajik poet Sadriddin Ayni. While Ayni also suffers from his Tajik ancestry, some have pointed to Ayni as a figure who may be most palatable to the Emir, as he is far from the radical wing of the party, and is not as politically proactive as his opponents. If Qari and Mansurov were to descend into particularly nasty squabbling, those tired of the more distasteful side of politics may see Ayni, the somber and elder poet, in a whole new light."

 bukhara.1014.d:9 "The meeting was held in a dark room inside the home of a friend of Muhiddin Mansurov, hidden away from the prying eyes of the city. The demeanour of the participants was far from pleasant - there is little love lost between the reformists and Kushbeggi Nizamaddin Urganji. What the night lacked in friendship, however, it more than made up for in the urgency of the situation and determination of all members involved to survive. United by this mission, the two group, long sworn enemies, drafted an incredibly comprehensive case against the Atalyk, before moving together to confront the Emir, under the cover of darkness.\n\nThough the Emir was shocked and upset to be interrupted in the evening by a small army of councillors, ministers, and enemies of the state, he was quick to see that the writing was on the wall. After much hand-wringing and hem-hawing, he was forced to accept a number of this band's demands, including the reduction of control over certain military units by the Atalyk, the replacement of Ibrahim Bek's handpicked Palace Guard Commander with a Kushbeggi loyalist, and vague promises to reinstate the status quo of the 1920s. While none of those present are sure that the Emir will stick to these changes, the rapid support for their gambit by Russian agents has all but secured their position. With the Atalyk on the back foot, the question remains as to whether the Kushbeggi will retain his position of prominence, or if he will be swept away by the tide of optimism among the more radical members of the 'Anti-Atalyk Pact.'"

 bukhara.1015.d:9 "When the Kushbeggi prostrated himself before the Atalyk and his allies, he quickly found out just how close Ibrahim Bek had been to his planned military coup. Already, he had begun to amass loyal soldiers in the capital, using his friendship with the Commander of the Palace Guard to sneak Lokai loyalists into positions well suited to put the city under lockdown to smoke out the reformists.\n\nLuckily, and frankly surprisingly, the Atalyk was very receptive to the input of his new ally, and it did not take long for the Kushbeggi to provoke a few modifications to his plans. Instead of going door to door with bands of loyal soldiers to cleanse the city of any and all dissenters, the Kushbeggi proposed that they instead use the powers of the Emir to arrest the most odious reformists over a few days, before rooting out those disloyal from the bureaucracy and military. While some leftist rats may dig in and survive this more 'strategic' purge, the Kushbeggi was able to bring Ibrahim Bek to understand that with tensions rising, we cannot afford to risk our soldiers in a conflagration in the captial. Now, the two men stand shoulder to shoulder against liberalism of any kind, though the Kushbeggi has already begun to notice his hold over the ship of state slipping away, as his underlings increasingly turn to the Atalyk for direction and commands."

 bukhara.1016.t:9 "Crafting a New Constitution"
 bukhara.1016.d:9 "Ever since the “April Manifesto” of 1917 was strangled in the cradle, the liberal forces of Bukhara have clamoured for the promulgation of a constitution which strengthens the democratic process and provides basic protections for the Emirate's citizens. While there was some hope at the pinnacle of elder statesman Mirzo Abdulvahid Munzim's time as Chairman of the Communal Majlis that he would, with the support of the liberal Russian government, be able to navigate a constitution through the organs of government, the years following his death not only dashed away these hopes but threatened to undo any and all progress made towards democratising the nation.\n\nWith the Majlis reopened and a new Chairman appointed by the Emir, the time is ripe to create some legal foundations for a modern and liberal monarchy. Of course, no Constitution will be able to be carried into law without some form of support from the Emir and the Kushbeggi, meaning that many of the more radical members of the liberal movement will be disappointed with the resulting document. Notably, the Emir is obsessed with the 1906 Russian Constitution, meaning that it will unfortunately have to serve as the foundation of our proposals.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the Constitutional Committee has submitted a few draft proposals to the Kushbeggi and Chairman for their review. Unsurprisingly, the Committee demanded that the powers of the undemocratic Council of Ministers be folded into the Communal Council and the loopholes used by the Emir to circumvent the legislature be eliminated. Additionally, they have called for the provincial governments to be reformed to grant more powers to the local councils, namely the ability to elect and appoint Amlakdar officials and Qazi judges.\n\nThe Kushbeggi responded to this proposal with some comments, claiming that the draft documents would have to be modified slightly to be acceptable to the Emir. Namely, he has called for the Emir to retain the power to appoint some ministers, that the power to overturn monarchal vetoes be limited further, and that citizen rights which can be construed as “communistic” be scrubbed from the document. While it is likely that the Kushbeggi is only trying to save the powers of his own job, it is true that he has a good sense of the Emir's opinions, and we should not take his recommendations lightly."

The last years have proven conclusively the importance of a strong state and the dangers of a revolutionary populace, leaving the Kushbeggi with a serious conundrum.\n\nReforms, as odious as they may be, are necessary. The Kushbeggi has spent much of the last few weeks crafting and drafting a constitution which would codify many of the administrative and political reforms developed over the last months, while insulating the Kushbeggi and Emir from the whims of violent revolutionaries. Of course, the Kushbeggi has adhered closely to the provisions of the April Manifesto and the Emir's favoured 1906 Russian Constitution to create his own draft, and as a result his constitution is far from the dreams of the Young Bukharans and their ilk.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, a delegation of liberals have come to the Kushbeggi asking that he take their wishes into account, presenting him with a radical proposition to reform the government of the realm by consolidating the Council of Ministers and Communal Council into one body along with some other provisions which would limit the powers of the Emir. While such a move would only serve to weaken our glorious Emir and his Kushbeggi, it is true that the liberal opposition was critical to the defense of the Emirate against Ibrahim Bek's reign of terror, and further coordination with them may serve to critically reinforce our steady control of the realm."

This “constitution” would presumably bewitch our great leader, allowing this monstrous cabal foreign agents and cowardly atheists to seize control of the realm. Luckily, timely intervention by our Atalyk Ibrahim Bek prevented these men from carrying out their dastardly plot, and now that our court is cleansed of their sins there is little talk in the halls of the ark about “constitutions.”\n\nWhile the Atalyk holds court, there is only one voice which whispers about the benefits of written bounds of power - Russian agent and begrudging Ibrahim Bek ally Filipp Panov. Panov, an old friend of Boris Savinkov and long standing Russian figure within the Emir's inner circle, has long claimed that the Atalyk could seriously benefit from crafting his own constitution, one which would strip the last vestiges of power from the weakened Kushbeggi and solidify the grasp of the Atalyk over the state.\n\nOf course, most within the Atalyk's inner circle know that the very concept of a constitution spits on the honor of the Emir. After all, if he is divinely ordained, then why should he be beholden to some sort of piece of paper. Such a revolting document would be an unholy blemish on our realm! On the other hand, the notion of using our enemies' witchcraft against them is tempting, and Panov has made several cogent arguments backed up by his position of importance as a conduit between Bukhara and Moscow. The Emir himself has expressed some interest in such a document, perhaps thinking himself a new, more noble Nicholas II."

 bukhara.1025.t:9 "The Bukharan Constitution, Part 1"
 bukhara.1025.d:9 "The Introduction (Articles 1–2) declares that the Emirate of Turkestan is "one and indivisible" under the majesty of the Emir and his most loyal servant the Atalyk and mandates the use of Chagatai Persian within the court.\n\nChapter One (Articles 3–37) concerns the divine and sovereign powers of the Emir, listing his prerogatives as monarch of Turkestan. The Emir possesses supreme sovereign power and strict obedience to his commands is mandated by Allah. The Emir possesses sweeping prerogatives and is personally inviolable. He has the sole power to declare war, make peace and negotiate treaties, supreme command of the armed forces, the authority to mint money, the right to grant pardons, quash judicial proceedings, promulgate decrees, sole charge over the Emirate's administrative and external affairs, the sole power to appoint and dismiss his ministers, and the right to determine the nature and scope of their duties. The Emir has the power to appoint an Atalyk as his proxy and speaker, vesting them with the same powers and authority, and the Atalyk is beholden only to the Emir, who may recall them at any time.\n\nChapter Two (Articles 38–50) concerns issues of regency and accession of the Emir. The age of majority is sixteen and the Atalyk serves as the regent and has the power to select a regency council to administer in the Emir's stead. All males of the Emirate must swear and Oath of Allegiance to the Emir and his Atalyk upon his accession to the throne."
 bukhara.1025.a:0 "Intéressant ..."

 bukhara.1026.t:9 "The Bukharan Constitution, Part 2"
 bukhara.1026.d:9 "Chapter Three (Articles 51–54) concerns the relationship of the Emirate to the various religions professed by its subjects. The Sunni Islamic faith is declared the exalted state religion, and the Emir is required to profess that religion.\n\nChapter Four (Articles 55–61) concerns the rights and obligations of male Turkestani citizens. Citizens are guaranteed protection from arbitrary arrest and illegal search and seizure, guaranteed a limited right to travel and the right to own private property. The Emir may suspend these rights in times of emergency, and these rights are suspended for any citizens suspected of revolutionary allegiances or action. Military service and the payment of taxes is mandatory for all male subjects.\n\nChapter Five (Articles 62–70) regulates the operation of the Council of Ministers and the promulgation of laws. The Communal Council is disbanded, with all of their powers passing to the Council of Ministers. The Emir may directly appoint up to one-half of the Council of Ministers, while the other half are appointed by the Beyliks, Ulemma, and local councils. The Council of Ministers may propose legislation, subject to the approval of the Emir and his Atalyk. The Emir may issue binding decrees, though decrees which change the Constitution must be approved by the Council of Ministers. The Atalyk is afforded whatever budgetary powers are necessary to fund and expand the military, as needed."
 bukhara.1026.a:9 "To a glorious future under the Atalyk!"

 bukhara.1027.t:9 "Petitioning Russia for True Independence"
 bukhara.1027.d:9 "Technically, the Emirate of Bukhara is a fully independent state with close bonds of friendship with the great nation of Russia, but no legal mechanisms by which Russia can control or manipulate our sovereignty. However, in reality Russia leverages extensive control over our state through a legion of advisors and bureaucrats, who report directly to Moscow and often ignore the orders of their native ‘superiors,' creating a sort of ‘state within the state' which prevents us from fully enjoying the independence we legally have. While we are fully loyal to our Russian ally, there are growing efforts to loosen the lease Russia currently holds around us, especially as we grow more powerful. Of course, there is also the matter of Russian economic control, which has waned somewhat (from all encompassing to merely oppressive) as our own domestic industry and production has picked up. We have a few options: we can request that Russia withdraw some of their political control, and potentially offer increased economic control or compensation in return, or instead simply come to grips with our current position."
 bukhara.1027.a:9 "Request greater independence"
 bukhara.1027.b:9 "Offer compensation for independence"
 bukhara.1027.c:9 "Why even bother bothering them?"

 bukhara.1028.t:9 "Our Turkestani Allies Demand Greater Independence"
 bukhara.1028.d:9 "We created the Turkestani Emirate to secure our southern border and better regulate the native Turkic tribes, Sarts, and Persians of the region. To ensure their loyalty, we organised significant portions of their bureaucracy and government under the oversight of Russian agents within the Bukharan court, who have only grown more powerful in recent years. However, the Turkestani Emirate has grown powerful in its own right, with a growing army of once-disloyal Basmachi bandits now marching in lockstep with our armies in the great European conflagration. Recently, native diplomats have pushed for us to make major revisions to the role of Russian advisors within the Emirate's court, changes which would make them more independent. While officially the Emirate is merely an allied nation state within our sphere, their limited sovereignty has allowed us to closely control their affairs. Removing our agents from positions of control would certainly make Turkestanis happy - but obviously we are concerned that this may just be the first domino on the path to full Turkestani independence and revolt."
 bukhara.1028.a:9 "Grant them their request"
 bukhara.1028.b:0 "Si c’est un combat que les Britanniques veulent, alors ils l'auront!"

 bukhara.1029.t:9 "Russia Withdraws Some Tendrils of Control"
 bukhara.1029.d:9 "Recognising our increasing power and our long-standing loyalty, Russia has recalled a number of their leading ‘advisors,' loosening the foundations of their direct control over our administration. With more and more roles filled by our native Uzbeks, we are no longer beholden to the constant approval of our Russian allies. Of course, on a day to day level, not too much has changed - Russian support continues to be vital to the maintenance of the Emirate's administration, and a number of junior positions are still staffed by Russian or Russian educated experts. However, there is no doubt that the Sword of Damocles has been lowered somewhat. It is now doubtful that the Emir and his closest allies could be silently written out of our nation's governance, and if the Russians were to today attempt to overthrow our government they would encounter significantly more resistance than they once would have. This reversal marks a new chapter in our history, allowing us to truly spread our wings and show the world how mighty Central Asia can be!"
 bukhara.1029.a:0 "Fantastique!"

 bukhara.1030.t:9 "Russia Denies us our Requests"
 bukhara.1030.d:9 "Despite the reasonable and well laid out nature of our request to Moscow to loosen their informal controls on our government, we have been wholly rebuffed. Our diplomatic counterparts have contacted us through back channels explaining that while there may come a time when Russia is willing to further pull out of their political investments in our realm, that day has not yet come. The truth is that Russia has simply invested too much blood and treasure into securing our nation into their realm, and they cannot afford to now upset the applecart. To this end, they have warned us that any move on our part to circumvent or weaken their control will result in immediate military intervention, an intervention we would be wholly unable to withstand. Unfortunately, there is little we can do now, especially having shown our hand to our Russian counterpart with our requests. We will simply need to continue dreaming of a future where we can be a free and equal partner of our Russian ally."
 bukhara.1030.a:9 "Then we must stand down..."
