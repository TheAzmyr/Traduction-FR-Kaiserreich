Although it is unlikely that the Ottomans will commit ground forces to an attempt for reconquest, our spies have nonetheless reported that the Rashidi Princes were \"pleased\" with the answer they received, indicating that some form of assistance is likely to arrive.\n\nThis situation is also opening up the al-Subhani family to unrest and division amongst the Central Arabian tribes as whilst many may not wish to fight for the Rashidis out of loyalty, a bribe (paid by Ottoman gold) could quickly tip the scales back in favour of the Rashidis and usher in the downfall of our ruling house."

 ireland_events.1006.d:9 "There was surpise and consternation at this week's cabinet meeting, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs notified the government of a most unusal offer from the Union of Britain; that they return to us the corpse of Sir Roger Casement, the Anglo-Irish anti-imperialist campaigner and hero of the independence era. Against his own wishes, Casement was buried in an English prison following his execution in 1916 for treason, after he ran guns from Germany to Ireland for the Easter Rising.\n\nAn immediate and rowdy debate ensued amongst the cabinet about whether this is some kind of ploy by the British, or a genuine attempt at soothing relations. The British, for their part, have presented this as an olive branch that will coincide with the 21st anniversary of the Easter Rising.\n\nWhile the opportunity to give Casement a proper burial is extremely appealing, some members of the cabinet have noted this deal would require at least some kind of glad-handing of the Union of Britain, if not an outright public acknowledgement of them as a \"fellow Republic\".\n\nIt would be difficult for the government to publicly sing the Union of Britain's praises in return for Casement, but on the other hand, refusing the offer might be tantamount to political suicide, as the opposition and public would never claim to understand it."

Radio Free Scotland, even in its earliest stages, was a success — if not too much so.\n\nArmed with a modern, powerful long range transmitter, Radio Free Scotland was able to live up to its promise to reach both Edinburgh and Glasglow from its station in County Down. Although they were aware of the need to thread a reasonable line, the station nonetheless became a vital lifeline for dissenters in Scotland.\n\nIn its wake has been a noticeable stream of Scottish exiles secretly crossing the North Channel by boat, organised by Andrew Dewar Gibb in Scotland, and his associate Arthur Donaldson, a department store manager in Dublin, both of the right wing Scottish National Party, and hostile to the Union of Britain. Their presence, and their anti-syndicalist aims, has been welcomed by those of Ulster-Scots descent in the north of the country.\n\nOf the new arrivals, some are here simply to escape their lives in the Union of Britain, some are clearly here to actively organise against it, but there are undoubtedly also some infiltrators who have arrived on our shores with nefarious intent. While the idea of Ireland as a beacon of liberty and safe haven will play well domestically, internationally this is a dangerous game, and the government must decide on how they wish to proceed."

 ireland_events.2031.d:9 "When one looks back at the events of the past few decades, few could truly have ever predicted the events that have transpired. From the loss of the first War, the shattering of the Empire, and even now with the victory in the second, it would all seem like outlandish fantasy if your average Briton had heard any of it at the dawn of the Great War. What would likely seem the most outlandish however, would be the events of today, where [IRE_loc_leader_name], the leader of an independent Irish nation, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] not as a subject of the crown or an enemy of it but as one of its most important allies.\n\nWhile most of the [IRE_loc_leader_title]'s visit has been purely dedicated to the discussion of logistical and functional concerns that have arisen with the Entente's new place in the world, the symbolic importance of it has not gone unnoticed. Regardless of the centuries of grievances that have built up between the British Crown and the Irish people, the Ireland that [IRE_loc_leader_surname] represents while standing here today is one that is willing to move beyond them. It is an Ireland that was willing to offer a hand to Britain when it had fallen to its lowest point, and it is an Ireland that has subsequently helped pulled Britain back up onto its feet, so that they may now stand together on equal footing.\n\nAnd with such an effort made on their part, it isn't hard for even the most ardent British nationalist to admit that such a future where Ireland and Britain are equal partners is ultimately a desirable one for both nations, and one that they should strive to maintain."
 ireland_events.3625.d3:9 "The President, William O'Brien, has had a difficult few months. From ruling as the elected leader of the country in a time of national crisis, to being overthrown in a military coup, and to being put back in a position of the same name by the Union of Britain, even if an entirely different and lesser role, it has been a time of radical change for a moderate-minded trade unionist. However, rather than struggling to come to terms with what was likely to be his complete political humiliation, O'Brien has used all his powers to ensure that the fate intended for him shall not come to pass.\n\nO'Brien has made himself indispensable to RN Tweedy, and other former entryists into the Progressive Labour Party, who had plotted the Second Revolution from within government. He acts as a link to those outside of the party or even the left, as they are aware of his initially unwilling participation in the British-sponsored regime, and see him as far more favourable to work with than the likes of O'Donnell or Larkin.\n\nIn exchange for opening up these channels of communication and very slowly building acknowledgement of the new regime across the political sphere, O'Brien has begun to ever so subtly influence the ruling cadre's policies. He is eager to ensure that even though Ireland's revolution was built on British arms, it will not remain so that way. And if Ireland is to be socialist, he must do what he can to ensure it is on its own terms."

Being regarded as the \"Father of Irish Republicanism\" it is no surprise to see a sea of Irish flags waved by the processioners, but the less informed observer may be surprised to see them waving side by side with the flag of France.\n\nIf there is one nation that Ireland has been able to continuously count on throughout history to come to its aid, it has been France. United initially by faith, the French sent soldiers to help Irish Catholics in their fight against William of Orange in an attempt to establish an independent Ireland, albeit one still ruled by a British king. It was with the French revolution that France's relationship with Ireland moved beyond faith, and so one hundred and forty years ago they would send brave men to fight alongside Wolfe Tone, irrespective of him being a Protestant rather than a Catholic. This event made the year 1798 become known in Ireland as \"Bliain na bhFrancach\", the \"Year of the French\", and it has permanently defined Ireland's relationship with France to this day."

 united_states_crisis_events.501.d:9 "After a long and contentious hearing process, the Senate has finally voted to confirm the nomination of Huey Long as Attorney-General. Long's nomination some time ago came as the culmination of the deal made between himself and the President Borah, as in exchange for Long's backing on his domestic agenda, Borah appointed Long to one of the most prestigious positions in the cabinet. Though the Justice Department is not expected to play a huge role in wartime policy, it will importantly be tasked with advising on the legality of wartime policy, including framing important wartime legislation which the president may seek to pass, as well as with overseeing the prosecutions of many reds in federal territory.\n\nAs a controversial figure in the best of times, many conservative and anti-Long senators questioned the ability and suitability of Long to lead the Justice Department. They have called into question his qualifications for the position, (though Long is a decorated lawyer), as well as the circumstances of the \"corrupt bargain\", which supposedly occurred between Long and Borah. Some critics also pointed out that Long would now have the ability to block federal investigations into his own party machine in Louisiana, which is infamous for corruption, graft, and even instances of forced labour. There have in turn been concerns that Long will use his position to prosecute political opponents under the guise of national security.\n\nNevertheless, with national unity a valuable commodity, the Senate has approved the nomination. Long will now sit in Borah's wartime cabinet, a dramatic rise for a man who made a name for himself decrying establishment politics."

Feng Guozhang recommended him to enter the 6th Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where he would continue studying artillery. Returning to China in 1909, Zhou met Sun Chuanfang while the two were taking the same military examination of the Ministry of Army of the Qing dynasty. During the early Republican Era, Zhou was stationed in various positions in the Central Army as an artillery officer, and became an Major General by 1918.\n\nWhile stationed in Hunan, Zhou was assigned to Chen Guangyuan who was to serve as the Governor of Jiangxi. In 1923, Anhui Clique Governor Wang Yongquan declared his independence from the Zhili-dominated Beijing Government, and Zhou was assigned to Sun Chuanfang in a campaign to retake Fujian Province from Wang. Zhou was left in command of Fujian Province as Sun moved north to take Zhejiang and then help Qi retake Jiangsu from the Fengtian Clique. Zhou took the blunt of the initial push of the KMT during the Northern Expedition and had to retreat north to Zhejiang.\n\nHowever, the Kuomintang war effort would collapse soon after, and Zhou retook Fujian Province. Zhou was notorious in Fujian for levying exorbitant taxes against the local population, which pushed them to assist the nascent Kuomintang insurgency which spawned in the aftermath of the Shanghai Uprising in 1932. While Zhou nominally controls all of Fujian, his actual authority is mostly concentrated alongside the coastline and major cities.§!\n\n§YNotes: While Sun disapproves of Zhou's handling of Fujian's governance, the two men share a long standing friendship and Zhou will support the League-Marshal in all future endeavours.§!"
 LEP_the_marshal_stands_triumphant_desc:9 "The uppity fools following Governor Chen and the damnable spirits of the Kuomintang thought they could supersede the League! Yet we have undeniably put them back in their place! With the formal ascension of Qi Xieyuan to the role of League Marshal following Sun's truly tragic death, the duty falls upon us to continue the plans of the \"Smiling Tiger\"."
 league_events.14.d:9 "A tense air hung in the League Marshal's palace. News had arrived in advance that the independent investigator hired by Marshal Qi had concluded his report and research into the terrible murder of Sun Chuanfang. As expected, the investigator and his team intend to receive an audience with Marshal Qi and Tian Wenbing in order to reveal the \"revelations\" to the League Marshal. Of course, the Marshal already knows who the culprit is, and whilst he did not collaborate with the other players that brought down the Smiling Tiger, he nonetheless quite magnificently manouvered his way through the quagmire and mania. Finally achieving his penultimate position, any information within the investigative report that could lead to Qi would undoubtedly not leave this palace.\n\nSitting rather patiently within his office, a subtle knock would manifest upon his door, as Tian adjorned by the investigation team waltzed into the Marshal's lair. Sitting within the singular chair situated opposite of the Marshal, Tian would stand next to his master as the investigator produced a sealed folder from his briefcase. Presenting it to the League Marshal, Qi callously tore open the folder, as the investigator began to disclose his team's findings.\n\nIt would appear that their investigation concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by none other than... the League Marshal himself! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun, Shi Jianqiao, was not at all related to Qi. In-fact she acted independently! Instead it focused on the aftermath, with Qi's suspicious activity following Sun entering into a coma. Utilising the chance brought forth following his orchestration of the AOG purchase, Qi would finish what Shi started, killing Sun in his sleep.\n\nThe investigation team had already sealed their fates walking into that room. Second hand reports indicate that after a brief commotion, a series of gunshots were heard echoing from the palace gardens. However they brought little attention, as firefights are now a common occurrence in Nanjing."
 league_events.17.d:9 "In the early hours of this morning, Qi's forces were able to fully capture the Arsenal in Nanjing. Following the deposition of Sun, and the \"coup\" of Qi, Nanjing's forces were split between Sun loyalists and Qi loyalists. Attempts to force Sun's closest top ranking commanders like Xie Hongxun to order these soldiers to stand down failed, as Xie refused to budge.\n\nMany of these troops, their commanding officers, and those within the highest ranks of the military high command still believe Qi is not fit to rule, with some even suggesting that Qi killed Sun himself during the latter's coma so he could take the role of League-Marshal for himself. Since Qi took power, fighting in Nanjing has been widespread and sporadic, with Sun loyalists mainly staging their defiance around the Nanjing Arsenal.\n\nWith the Arsenal's position was one of China's most prolific arms and ammunition manufacturing depot, it proved a tough nut to crack. Even in spite of Qi's elite German trained and armed soldiers. With the fighting brutal, reportedly numerous soldiers died on the League Marshal's side. That was, until Marshal Qi granted permission to utilise artillery.\n\nDevastating the arsenal, the barrages obliterated the defenders. Whilst machinery and the structure is damaged, it is a small price to pay for Qi's continued domination. After all, more is sure to follow."
 league_events.41.d:9 "Regular patrols of the League's soldiers are a normal, annual occurrence in the aftermath of the League Collapse. With the National Revolutionary Army waging a guerrilla war under the auspices of Deng Yanda, the atmosphere in rural, isolated areas is reminiscent of the days in 1927 following the first collapse of the Kuomintang. Far dislodged from a wide sweeping insurgency, it nonetheless still proves dangerous for our men.\n\nReportedly conducting a regular patrol today, a group of our soldiers were ambushed by a band of Kuomintang guerrillas near [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Swiftly encircling our men, they successfully overpowered and killed them. Further parties were planned to be dispatched to find the culprits, but were ultimately deemed futile."
 league_events.45.d:9 "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei and the MinGan Insurgency led by Song Qingling and Deng Yanda, tensions have remained high in [?LEP_KMT_attack_location.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The military presence of our units and the Kuomintang sympathies of the local populace have resulted in minor conflicts occurring commonly. Such scuffles and skirmishes were bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, walked past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to fire shots at them.\n\nKilling one soldier but being put down by the rest, his supposed sacrifice was but a mere distraction. As while our soldier's attention was diverted towards the singular target, a large group of National Revolutionary Army troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, vanquishing all of them.\n\nReceiving acclamation from the populace, the NRA soldiers began to secure more peasants for their little uprising. As the day went on, more of the League's loyal soldiers rose to challenge the NRA, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, as the NRA soldiers disappeared into the dark."
 league_events.53.d:9 "Regular patrols of the League's soldiers are a normal, annual occurrence in the aftermath of the League Collapse. With rural banditry having seen a startingly rise since the League War, even our own men are not safe from their clutches. Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of well-armed bandits. These people, whose had lost everything in the League War, reverted to robbing and looting to sustain their livelihoods. Such acts became infamous in the local village, leading to the local magistrate instituting a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty of its militia, and ten of our own soldiers have now been killed."
 league_events.54.d:9 "Again the massive loss of authority within Jiangsu province has resulted in massive chaos occurring. This time however, one of the larger bandit clans managed to invade and occupy an entire town. After recruiting the former occupants, and imprisoning those who resisted, various soldiers under the authority of Zheng Junyan were sent to investigate. Only to be met with the entire town barricaded, fortified, and preparing for a siege. Drafting a larger amount of soldiers, Zheng Junyan's subordinate managed to drive away the bandits, allowing the village people imprisoned to be released. Despite killing hundres of bandits, many of them fled with their new recruits from the village, replacing their losses. Whilst our men that perished will not see as swift reinforcements."

 ukraine_events.30.d:9 "When things seemingly couldn't get any worse, today the streets of [202.GetName] ran red with blood.\n\nIn Khreshchatyk Square, long a hub for political rallies, workers and peasants took to strike and demanded release of political prisoners, end to arbitrary arrests and for the Hetman to accept VDR's social-political programme. The police attempted to disperse the protest, but after a shot was fired - it is not sure if the shooter was a policeman or a protester - chaos broke out. Police were bombarded with stones, and some protestors even had revolvers. Fire was answered, and in the end dozens of protestors lay dead or wounded.\n\nWhile the full situation has yet to become clear, opposing political organisations have declared the Hetman and his government to be murderers, and this has only emboldened the protestors."
 ukraine_republican_events.101.d:9 "Following Hungary's revolt and eventual defeat Zakarpatia found itself transferred to Galicia-Lodomeria following the negotiations at the Augsleich. Now it finds itself at crossroads once more.\n\nIn the early years of Ukrainian independence their claims didn't just encompass the broader region of Galicia-Lodomeria but also the small regions of south-eastern Western Galicia and Eastern Slovakia, based around the Ukrainian population living in the mountains. Yet many in the region, while pertaining many similarities, ultimately see themselves as to having a separate identity.\n\nEither way, the pan balance is set. Shall we transfer it to Ukraine and settle the issue in their favour? Or instead retain it to please those in the cabinet that are sceptical of Ukraine's true loyalties and the local population that wish to retain their identity (that may come under threat from the Ukrainian government) under the Habsburg monarchy?"
 ukraine_republican_events.110.d:9 "As the new year dawns, Chairman Vynnychenko took the moment to convene the National Zbory. Reduction in poverty, land for all, and a new industrial base unthinkable in the Hetmanist era were all key themes in the beginning of Vynnychenko's opening statement - but though these were nice to hear, they were not the theme of Vynnychenko's speech.\n\nThe elephant of the room was the matter of national defence. Russia's belligerent actions on the world stage and their denial of Ukrainian statehood made it clear that if Ukraine were to survive, this matter would be of the utmost importance. For the first time since the Workers' Democratic Union's election, military spending was to be a priority above all else. Vynnychenko's words electrified the National Assembly with applause and cheers - after all, who would be against such a patriotic endeavour?\n\nBut after Vynnychenko had left the spotlight, a discussion began to take place, one which would likely have garnered significantly less applause in the Zbory. Gathering a number of R-RB and UPS-R ministers, as well as Generals Tiutiunnyk and Volokh, Vynnychenko petitioned Tiutiunnyk to draw up plans for a defence of Ukraine from the Russians, but from the Germans to the west.\n\nWith a new Great War to potentially come to Europe soon, fears that Germany may take action against the Ukrainian government are no longer just talk. The question is of the nature of these plans: should they only be of a defensive manner, or should they account for the possibility of decisive Third Internationale success and potential offensive manoeuvres into the western Reichspakt?"
 ukraine_republican_events.162.d2:9 "With the Russian arms industry rapidly inflating and Moscow becoming more belligerent as time goes on, there have been whispers in the National Zbory about a proper response. Gradually, all parties are beginning to understand the severity of the Russian threat. A debate on the necessity of national defence seems inevitable.\n\nHowever, it seems that it will just be talk for the foreseeable future. With the coalition having broken up, there is little chance that the bill will pass the National Zbory, let alone be voted on at all."

During the Guangxu Era, Bai Wenwei participated in military training and it was around this time that he met Chen Duxiu, another prominent anti-Qing activist in Anhui.\n\nDuring his revolutionary period in Zhejiang, he also grew close to other revolutionaries such as Chen Qimei and Huang Xing. An early member of Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Revolutionary Party, he would grow to be quite close to the top leadership in the revolutionary movement. When Yuan Shikai betrayed on the promises of the revolution, Bai Wenwei would end up joining Sun Yat-sen's revived Kuomintang in order to ensure the revolution's survival.\n\nDuring the reorganisation of the Kuomintang, Bai Wenwei supported the alliance with the LCS as well as the support for the Third Internationale against Germany's capitalist imperialism. When the Northern Expedition failed, Bai decided to flee with Wang Jingwei's Central Committee - seeing it as the true remaining bastion for Sun's ideals. Since exile, he has continued to remain a senior member of the RCA and is loyal to their efforts of effectively reorganising the Chinese Nationalist Party and truly achieving China's liberation.§!\n\n§YNotes: A senior member of the Kuomintang due to his age, Bai is respected by many within the NRA although pledges loyalty to the Reorganised Comrades Association, seeing them as the best means of maintaining steady leadership akin to Dr. Sun's visions.§!"

With our control over the resources and industries of the Chinese nation, we have taken the first great steps towards the National Reconstruction envisioned by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen."
 CHI.earlygame.300.d:9 "For the past four years, Kuomintang forces under the reorganised National Revolutionary Army had been fighting a brutal guerrila war against the League of Eight Provinces in the Min-Gan Insurgency zone between the regions of Fujian and Jiangxi. Despite a valiant uprising following the new year, it appears that once more the Kuomintang finds itself on the run and that the Second National Revolutionary Army was unable to complete the mission set out by its predecessors.\n\nAs Kuomintang politicians and officers flee across the country or for abroad for their second-largest exile since the collapse of the Northern Expedition, tattered remains of the insurgent zone including several well-trained officers such as Lin Biao and Xu Xiangqian have managed to traverse across the country and have arrived to the border of Shanaxi province to seek asylum and have pledged their loyalty to Shanxi's provincial armies. They are also joined by RCA politicians and intellectuals who have long links with Shanxi's revolutionary cadre and will no doubt seek to continue on the legacy of Dr. Sun in Shaanxi Province. While adding these valiant soldiers to our forces could bolster our ranks with experienced and veteran officers, there is also the concern that these Kuomintang exiles may carry radical teachings and it may be advisable that we keep our borders secure and our people safe from radicalism."

 CHI.endgame.245.d:9 "Organisation is the key to success according to members of the RCA-Radicals, who believe that a truly educated revolutionary vanguard must be organised well in order to lead the National Revolution for the Workers and Peasants. Thanks to the dominance of the Radical wing of the RCA, the RCA has enforced its highly rigid means of organisation upon the entire Party.\n\nThe headquarters of the RCA and Chen Gongbo's main centre of operations is the \"United Office of Provinical, Municipal, and Overseas Party Branches\" - allowing Premier Chen to monitor and manage RCA activities within the country and overseas. It is further supplemented by the \"Chinese Kuomintang Party Defending Revolutionary Alliance\", an RCA organisation created in secret in Shanghai in order to win over the support of the Chinese socialists and syndicalists.\n\nNew membership to the RCA is a highly arduous process. A prospective member of the RCA could only be considered for membership provided that he knew at least two other RCA members. Following a probation period of one to three months, he would become a full member only if approved by the next level of hierarchy. RCA members are organised in cells of three to nine men, and the hierarchy is graded into sub-branches, sub-districts, districts, provincial levels, and national levels.\n\nAt the encouragement of the Radicals, a tight enforcement line is administered of the RCA in order to protect the unity of the Party. Meetings of local RCA cells are to be held every week and attendance is mandatory. All decisions from the Premier are to be assumed to be instructions from the great Chairman and thus must be obeyed no matter what. Mid-level to higher level members are encouraged to keep reports on individual members such as a report of their whereabouts, report on their residences, and a weekly activity report.\n\nFurthermore, the training programme of the RCA stresses that members are to follow a single unified ideology, to maintain stringent discipline, to obey the RCA rather than individuals, and to work with the masses. Nonetheless, the Moderates have petitioned the Premier to relax these standards, arguing that without the PAC - there is no longer a need to maintain such strict control of the clique. They fear such a harsh system will soon be extended to the entire party."
 CHI.endgame.445.d:9 "In the history of modern China, there has perhaps been no other exceptional individual than the Party's founder - Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Known also as Sun Wen or Sun Zhongshan, the late Dr. Sun's work as a revolutionary martyr, pioneer, and philosopher inspired the Kuomintang movement. Dr. Sun truly grasped China's socio-political reality and helped revive the idea of Zhonghua by establishing a revolutionary party and army - he founded the very ideals that had helped secure the victory of the Second Northern Expedition.\n\nThis year, the Nationalist Government has officially granted a position of eternal honour to the late Premier of the Revolution by assigning him the name \"Guofu,\" meaning \"Father of the Nation.\" Through his endless revolutionary struggle, often marked with failure and exile, the revolution he inspired carried on - and in the end, has fully unified and freed China after decades of strife.\n\nHaving died before the Northern Expedition commenced, Sun's corpse lay in the Western Hills of [GetVictoryPointName_9843] for years. However, following the Second Northern Expedition's success, his body was properly returned to Nanjing to rest. The Nationalist government has commissioned the architect's Lu Yanzhi and Huang Tanpu to commission building a mausoleum to honour Sun forever. This majestic project combines traditional styles of imperial tombs and modern architecture, along with a tri-arched gate inscribed with Dr. Sun's quote, \"What is under Heaven belongs to all.\" A sacrificial hall is to be built with the ceiling painted with the glorious flag of the Kuomintang while Sun's body lies interned - guarded forevermore by ever-present armed guards; his memory and legacy will be treasured for generations to come."

Reforms and policy shifts will be needed to accommodate Egypt in their journey toward reintegrating into the broader Ottoman economy. Many specifics remain to be answered however, especially the nature of our relationship after this latest bloodletting.\n\nTwo camps have formed in the Grand Vizier's circle; the first argues the war was a massive drain on the treasury and excessively taxing to the political stability of the realm thereby necessitating Egypt be subjected to close oversight and intensive economic integration to recoup on these losses and more quickly build up the overall regional economy.\n\nConversely, those opposed to this strategy vehemently argue that such punitive measures will undo any amount of good faith built across the Arab provinces by so directly oppressing a proud center of Arab culture, counter proposing that the Khedivate should be given great leeway in the day-to-day running of affairs allowing the Ottoman State to eventually become a benign guarantor of the security and prosperity of the reintegrating Middle East. In this way, ensuring a future conflagration of anti-Ottoman nationalism is preempted and not given the air to breathe.\n\nOnly one thing is certain, winning a war against some disparate nationalist mobs masquerading as armies is not the end of conflict."

Entering the First Qinghe Army Preparatory School in Beijing in 1912, Liu would transfer to the 3rd Class of the Baoding Military Academy to study infantry.\n\nGraduating alongside the likes of Bai Chongxi, he would undergo training in Ni Sichong's army, serve in various capacities such as captain staff officer for Wu Guangxin, police inspector for Zhang Jingyao, and major deputy of the 9th Mixed Brigade. In 1920, he would serve as staff director of the Lin Mi Brigade, deputy lieutenant colonel and battalion commander of the Second Mixed Regiment of the Fujian Army, and in 1925 he became an officer in the remnants of the Anhui Army under Ma Xiangbin. Participating in the war against Zhang Zongchang, Liu would ultimately join with the rest of the forces of Anhui province, becoming deputy commander of the Anhui Army.\n\nTo prevent the former Anhui loyalists from coalescing against him, Sun Chuanfang fully integrated their forces into the League's structure.

Or that of Bian Shoujing, an exemplary revolutionary turned to corruption due to exposure to the Assembly for a prolonged period.\n\nHowever they all pale absolutely in the magnifent splendor, as he claims himself, of Minister of Finance Wang Kemin. One of the older members of the cabinet, Wang has become a favourite of the international, and local, banking worlds. Not proficient in the actual managing of finance, Wang's excellent memory allows him to recite the numbers in bookkeeping nonetheless, and has amassed quite a serious fortune.\n\nIndispensable to the government due to his capacity to obtain large amounts of funding from his foreign bank friends, Wang is otherwise a prickly, aging, and lackadaisical politician whom interrupts most cabinet meetings by lording himself over younger members of the clique present at the meetings, such as Bai Jianwu, or Peng Yunyi. Even in spite of his seniority being dwarfed by that of Gao Lingwei. Aside from that, Wang's Ministry of Finance has overseen a remarkable improvement both in the debt and economic sectors, winning him continued praise within the Assembly."

Having continuously dodged telegrams, waved away Beijing Liaison clerks and civil servants alike, and refused meetings with Marshal Wu, President Cao or any official from the Central Government, they have grown tired of our uncertainty. Emerging victorious in another major conflict, the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding undoubtedly reign supreme over the Chinese Nation yet again.\n\nA strongly worded message has travelled down from Beijing, clearly dictated personally by Marshal Wu. He has demanded that our government parley with the Central Authority in Beijing, and subsume ourself to their authority. Riding off of a high of their victorious war, it is likely that they have no reservations about annihilating us if we refuse yet again. Our border guards already make reports of soldiers under the command of Marshal Wang assembling on our shared border. The clock is ticking..."

Without Kempf's authority and influence, it's likely that our country would've fallen to the Russian invaders. Now that the invasion has been thrwarted and our eastern interests settled, there has been talk of disbanding the Generalgouvernement and cede power back to civilian authorities.\n\nThese talks have reached the National Democratic Association, the alliance of moderate opponents of the Social-Democrats and reluctant supporters of the Central Rada, and they have voiced their opposition to a transfer of power to the unpopular Rada. Their leader, Adam Stankievič, has submitted a petition directly to the General-Governor's office, requesting that the Sojm be restored and power transferred back to it instead.\n\nGeneral-Governor Kempf has the option to forward the petition to his superiors in Berlin, who may decide to allow White Ruthenia to rebuild its democracy, or to use his authority to maintain the military government."

Denouncing the Industrial Unionists for having \"sold the party to the anarchists of the IWW\", the supporters of Norman Thomas walked out to form the rival American Commonwealth Party, inspired by the radical faction of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and intended to be the representative of moderate socialism in the years to come.\n\nMeanwhile, a battle was occurring in the halls of the CIO. the TUEL, under the leadership of William Foster and Earl Browder, attempted to push forward Foster's candidacy for the presidency of the union. Though the TUEL built momentum during the civil war, it was ultimately not enough to oust incumbent Sidney Hillman, who won re-election by a larger than expected margin. In the aftermath, the TUEL floundered; Foster announced he would retire from public life due to ill health, while Browder led what remained out of the CIO to found the rival Trade Union Unity League (TUUL), a dual union with many of the same views as the old TUEL.\n\nAs the dust settled, what remained was a de-facto two-party system. Once the IWW accepted affiliation with the SPA, and the CIO came to a similar arrangement with Commonwealth, the main unions in the country aligned with the new system. Only the TUUL remains isolated, though few consider the rump a threat to the newly established order."

He became active in the socialist movement from an early age, becoming involved in the 1898 popular uprisings. The aftermath saw him exiled to Marsaille, then Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, only being able to return to Italy in 1903.\n\nWhen he came back, he became active in the trade union movement and later became leader of the socialist youth in Rome. He opposed the Libyan war and got himself elected to parliament as part of the PSI in 1913. However, when the Weltkrieg began, he opposed them and called for interventionism on the entente side, alongside Mussolini. After fighting for his country, he formed a paramilitary unit alongside Mussolini and d'Annunzio called the blackshirts, which fought for syndicalism and against Austrian influence during the ICW.\n\nIn the new socialist republic he remained prominent within the fascist movement, though Mussolini took most of the spotlight. The latter's autocratic tendencies caused de Ambris to view him with distrust, though he remained committed to the fascist cause as an organiser for the fascist paramilitaries. He joined the cabinet during Giulietti's and Mussolini's governments, always retaining a prominent role.\n\nWhen Mussolini was tragically assassinated, Togliatti tried to subvert everything the fascist movement stood for, but de Ambris led the blackshirts in recapturing power from that traitor. Now standing atop a united Italy, his governance will likely see the blackshirts more unleashed than they were even under Mussolini - a dangerous predicament for revisionists and reactionaries alike.§!"

After all, our Revolution is not merely political or even economic: it is social, paradoxically a rejection-and-fulfillment of the ideal of Social Democracy. Prominent Industrial Unionist and leading party Theoretician Louis Fraina has taken the floor of the congress to argue that in the present moment the WCA has the opportunity to enact a decisive change: the total equalization of all pay - specifically, by letting local communes collectively set wages. While thus far local communes have fixed prices and handled the distribution of salaries, the institution of a single universal salary for all workers would be a massive step in the decommodification of production - and thus the ending of capitalism.\n\nProgressive Caucus leader Norman Thomas took the stand to warn against a hasty adoption of Fraina's motion, warning that such a move could drive away many newly radicalized moderates among so-called skilled labor and the other petit bourgeois forces that joined our cause, namely many local AFL chapters, Farmer-Labor affiliates, and even Proudhonist-minded Anarchists. Sticking to the most radical of prewar agreements, tepid as they seemed now, at least for the duration of the Civil War, could serve as a vital means of incentivizing the military production necessary for victory.

The Atalyk, father to all the nation, the Emir included, was a guiding light for those who had once found themselves tempted by the siren's call of western imperialist thinking - the decadence and hedonistic obsession of the European courts. Where the progressives offered confusion and anger - all aimed at addling the minds of the young so that they may be corrupted - the Atalyk offered true certainty. Certainty of mind, certainty of body, and certainty of action.\n\nThe traitors in Samarkand needed to be destroyed. Those weak enough to be convinced by devils' words to support these traitors must also be destroyed. The whole of Central Asia needed to be cleansed of the rot and filth which had taken root, imported by Russian masters in an effort to further chain their Turkic slaves. Thousands may need to die for this cause, but they will die as martyrs, in the service of a better and brighter realm.\n\nThe young officers worked tirelessly - officials would be assassinated, noble generals lost in ‘accidents,' and activists publicly strung up. The revolution in Bukhara would not come from the disease of the left, but from the medicine of the right - the righteous followers of Ibrahim Bek.\n\nWhen the cards had all been aligned, and the pieces put into careful order, the last order was given - throw the Kushbeggi from his lofty post and sequester the Emir, so that he may be shielded from those who would wish him harm with weapons and words alike."
