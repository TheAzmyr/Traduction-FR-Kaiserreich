 central_asia_preparation_level_2_desc:9 "In the ancient persian tale of the scorpion and the turtle, even as the turtle works diligently in the service of itself and its friend the scorpion, the scorpion cannot help but do its best to kill them both. Such is the nature of the scorpion, and such is also the nature of the Tribal headman and Basmachi warlord, who knows nothing more than to hoard power personally and to resist any attempt to reform our military into a modern fighting force. By stifling our attempts to reform our army, these men have secured their positions as headsmen, all while dooming themselves and their nations to foreign conquest and failure."
 cacrisis.300.d:9 "While Khiva is no stranger to bands of secretive visitors filling the city's tea houses and caravansaries with an ocean of hushed tones and foreign garbs, a group of recent arrivals from Baku have raised eyebrows. They lack the typical look of merchants or fugitives, and have gone around the city, asking confusing questions regarding troop movements and operations during the Russian Civil War in distant accents and broken Uzbek. Many within the Royal Court have become convinced that these men are foreign spies. An investigation headed by Aziz Khan has come up with a bizarre explanation for these figures, however: their leader, an Ottoman Turk named Baha Said, is a former Ottoman researcher and aircraft inspector with close ties to the disgraced Unionist movement and the underground anti-government Karakol Society. Our own agents have some tertiary experience with this secret society, as several former members of Enver Pasha's ill-fated Army of Islam made Khiva their home after it was crushed in the Caucasus - smuggling funds through our network of clandestine trade in Anatolia while supporting our rearmament program with contacts and connections.\n\nCalling in some of our agents, we managed to organise a meeting between Baha Said and Junaid Khan to determine the purpose of this expedition. These men are searching desperately for the corpse of their long lost leader, Ismail Enver Pasha, who disappeared in Central Asia more than a decade ago. With the concerns of Ottoman spying assuaged, Junaid Khan attempted to remember the fate of the exiled general, who had passed through Khiva by way of Baku. He had trumpeted his arrival as the coming of the true “General of Islam” who would unite the Turks and crush both the Red and White Russians, before departing down the Oxus towards Bukhara. The rumours claim that he did not make it much farther, and that he found his end on the Bukharan Emir's executioners block. Undeterred by Junaid Khan's cautionary tale, the Karakol expedition excitedly packed their things and departed, presumably towards the realm of Emir Alim Khan."

 china_events.122.d:9 "After weeks of growing tensions, the world can sigh a breath of relief. Faced with the possibility of a grinding war that would destabilise a fledging nation, China's leadership blinked first. They have decided to accept an agreement far from their lofty demands, agreeing to a treaty of non-aggression. Although the possibility of disarmament in the future remains a distant ambition, for now at least it appears that there will be peace in Asia."
 china_events.152.d:9 "The history of Chinese rule over Tibet is a long and complicated one. The Qing Dynasty first asserted direct control over the region when their soldiers aided the 7th Dalai Lama in expelling the Dzungar Khanate, appointing their own administrators known as Ambans to the region. Tibet became a \"Fanbu\" to the Qing, translated loosely as a vassal state. As Qing power waned, their ability to directly control Tibet was challenged both by Tibetan leaders and the British operating from India. After the British invasion of Tibet, the Qing made an effort to reassert their sovereignty over the region, sending an army to integrate Tibet by force while also securing British recognition of Chinese suzerainty.\n\nThe 1911 Xinhai Revolution saw Qing rule collapse and the Tibetans had their revenge on the Chinese garrison by slaying their commander and forcing the survivors to withdraw. The new Republic maintained its claims on Tibet and attempted to secure the Dalai Lama's submission, however the 13th Dalai Lama argued that previous Chinese rule had not been subordination but rather a patron and priest relationship. The Lhasa government declared its independence along with the newly freed Mongolia. The British attempted to broker a deal similar to that of inner/outer Mongolia, with inner Tibet receiving autonomy under Chinese suzerainty while outer Tibet would be divided by Chinese administration and Tibetan religious authority. This convention broke down due to disputes over boundaries, further complicated by the status of contest Tawang and the Indian revolution.\n\nOur forces have successfully invaded Tibet, once again reasserting Chinese control over Lhasa. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933 upended the Tibetan political arena, leaving several competing factions that range from traditionalists in the monasteries and aristocracy to Khamba revolutionaries to court reformers. Within our own government, there have been calls to directly govern Tibet as a province to stamp out separatism, while others have advised providing autonomy to secure the loyalty of local allies."
 china_events.301.d:9 "Despite having their rule and control of China adequately challenged in the Northern Expedition, the subsequent Xuantong Restoration restored the Qing Empire and saw control of the North solidified by Wu Peifu, Cao Kun and the Zhili Clique.\n\nDespite the past years' unrest with the economic collapse of Black Monday and the League War, nonetheless, the Zhili have held on through the storm. While other warlords attempted to split from Zhili control, the Zhili nevertheless have defeated all competing governments, thus unifying China once more. In a glorious speech at [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Wu Peifu has declared that Zhili will seek to modernise China and assert her influence in the world once more."

 palcon.4.d:9 "Despite serving as a de jure part of the Sublime Porte and refusing to assist during the Arab Revolt of 1916, it is no secret that the Yemeni foster little warm feelings for their government in Kostantiniyye. Imam [YEM.GetLeader] has therefore sent his own representative to Cairo despite a warning of the Porte not to do so.\n\nUnlike some of our other Arab allies however, Yemen does not share our ambitions and remains focused inwards. Should the Ottoman government offer them a better deal than us, it would surprise no one that the Imam would bail on our plans."
 cp.25.d:9 "Without firing a shot, our army has succeeded in retaking the historically Georgian port of Batum as the Ottoman garrison in the city was ordered by Kostantiniyye to withdraw towards Rize. Although this a grand victory for Georgia, not all are convinced by the choice to kick the Turks whilst they are down. Pointing out dark shadows up North, they fear that should the Turks survive their ordeal the sovereignty of all Georgia might have just been compromised."

Their ideologies are at best loosely defined; sometimes they consist of some form of 'people's revival' or 'revolution by all classes', Quanmin Geming, but much more often they simply advocate for land reform.

Almost an accidental ally, too; a nebulous political body, the Anti-Concessions Movement is bound by only one thing — hatred of foreign imperialism. Chen's patriotic rhetoric swayed them to his side and launched him to prominence, but whether he can satisfy their expectations remains to be seen. Many members are tending increasingly towards radical ideas of popular democracy and a socialist-inspired state, hardly what Chen himself had in mind, and if their influence grows unchecked they might well make a nasty enemy unless Chen can appease them.

Chen, however, took no part in that suppression, and consequently the Vermillion Society lives on as a moderately influential organisation where others have fallen away.\nTaking their name from the vermillion-coloured headlines of the posters they spread around Shanghai, declaring hostility to the Qing and to warlordism, they've since established roots around the country and in the corridors of power. Their name is something of a pun, too, playing on one translation of vermillion (Zhongguohong): literally, 'Chinese red', reflecting their sympathy for leftist groups.\nThe individuals making up the Society are a varied lot; intellectuals, businessmen, and the obscenely wealthy dominate, however. Most members live and work in the concessions, with their origins lying in Robert Hotung's Chinese Club, founded in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, their most important characteristic is — paradoxically — anti-concessionism. They count among their ranks Chinese nationalists and republicans, and now they find themselves reaching out a generous hand to Chen — provided he's willing to make some concessions of his own, that is.§!\n"

Within it, however, one finds a not exactly harmonious arrangement of egos; Zhang-aligned warlords gone into retirement, Japanese businessmen, and a small core of optimistic intellectuals who seem to have truly bought into the Pan-Asian dream all make up this society. Standing in stark contrast to the Vermillion Society, though they pay lip service to many of the same ideals, the Xinhai Society harkens back to a time when the country had what they term 'legitimate unity' — that is, when all people could agree on was that the monarchy's days were numbered. Much like the Xinhai Society itself, in other words.\nThat isn't to say they're toothless, however. The Japanese market is an appealing one for many, and they have the quiet backing of many economic powerbrokers — financial resources often translated into political changes. Furthermore, Japan's primary involvement is through the ostensibly apolitical railway companies — giving them tremendous power with the appearance of being above the petty politics unfolding here. The quick mobilisation of troops was practically all that kept Sun's old League together, and it was a railway's construction that ultimately did it in. Many still remember the Railway Protection Movement that truly sparked Xinhai in 1911; if we were to anger either of our supporters or if their involvement became too unpopular, we might well discover that railways would once again launch a revolution... against us.§!\n"

'Liga Patriótica Argentina', as they called themselves, were responsible for the murder of hundreds of striking workers. In 1921 and 1922, during the rebellion in Patagonia, LPA forces caused gruesome acts of violence against strikers both in Patagonia and during a general strike in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1930 Liga participated in Uriburu's coup, who, with the support of the army and the LPA, ousted the government and installed a corporatist, ultranationalist military dictatorship. In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca became the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians.

 ARG_market_liberal_party_long:9 "Partido Demócrata Nacional\n§gThe PDN (PNA until 1932) was one of Argentina's oldest political parties and closely connected to the Roca family, who provided two Argentinian Presidents in the last 50 years: Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (1880-1886, 1898-1904) and Julio Argentino Pascual Roca (1932-1935).\n\nIt was created on March 15th, 1874, after the union of the Autonomist Party and the National Party. It was since its inception a highly important party, and the Roca family became very influential within the party, with Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz becoming a president in 1880-1886 and 1898-1904. It later became the bedrock of la edad de oro (1880 - 1916), boasting a booming economy and a flood of immigrants from Europe which strengthened Argentina's industry, becoming one of the most prosperous contries in the world before the Weltkrieg. Meanwhile, its main rival became the Radical Civic Union (UCR). It was criticised for its use of election fraud, which lead to PNA dissolving with its members joining Conservative Party and the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nFollowing Uriburu's death in early 1932, the PNA was reborn as Partido Demócrata Nacional (PDN) for the upcoming 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca being its leader, and PDN, thanks to electoral fraud, won by a landslide. Roca was inaugurated president, and he promised to find a compromise with their syndicalist neighbours Patagonia and Chile. Although many hoped that Roca would bring back the good old times and strengthen Argentina's position globally, this did not happen.\n\nAlthough he took a less radical course than Uriburu and developed plans to recapture the lost territories at Patagonia, launching small skirmishes into FOP territory and successfully retaking Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego thanks to the navy, he scrapped plans to send the army into Patagonian core territory, deciding to focus more on improving the economy. Roca's takeover disgruntled the military and the LPA, and due to his political liberalisation, rumours started to spread in 1935 that there would be an imminent peace settlement with the Patagonians, causing outrage across the nation. This was enough for Carlés and the LPA to launch a coup on Christmas day, putting Roca and his ministers under temporary house arrest as Carlés proclaimed himself President.\n\nFounded: §Y1932§!\nIdeology:\n- Economic liberalism\n- Conservative liberalism§!\n"
 ARG_social_liberal_party_long:9 "Unión Cívica Radical\n§gFounded on June 26th, 1891, the party quickly became influential over Argentine politics, causing the 1893 Radical Revolution and the 1905 Radical Revolution, which later led to reform in terms of election fraud. Two presidents of Argentina to be part of the Radical Civic Union were §YHipólito Yrigoyen§! and §YMarcelo Torcuato de Alvear§!.\n\nIn 1916 the Argentine General Election took place, being the first where the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was implemented, establishing universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage. Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR, ended up winning the elections.\n\nHis tumultous presidency between 1916 - 1922, with the secession of Patagonia, had de Alvear replace him as the UCR candidate for the 1922 elections, which he won. Argentina saw slight economic improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of April 1925. Despite this, de Alvear ordered the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. This increased morale and trust in the government, but led to the radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion, and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy.\n\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was surprisingly appointed as the Radical Civic's Union candidate for the general elections instead of the current and relatively popular Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Despite this, Yrigoyen won by a large margin, which led many to speculate that it was due to election fraud.\n\nYrigoyen's most important opposition was the military, which started planning a coup against him. This eventually happened on September 6th, 1930, as Uriburu, with support from Carlés and the LPA, took over and proclaimed himself president of Argentina, banning political parties, arresting democratic politicians and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Yrigoyen's supporters, called Yrigoyenists, were tortured alongside other political opponents of his regime. Yrigoyen himself was held under arrest at the Martín García Island.\n\nUriburu eventually died in early 1932, and Argentina went back to democracy under conservative politician Julio Argentino Pascual Roca.

 arm.1.d:9 "For centuries, foreign invaders have ruled the Armenian people. The Russians, Persians, and Ottomans all thought they had a righteous claim on our lands, resulting in numerous border conflicts between these powers. Even though the Armenian territories generally enjoyed relative autonomy, the Armenians themselves were typically treated poorly by their occupiers. The Turks, in particular, viewed them as second-class citizens that needed to be 'Turkified'. This belief led directly to the Hamidian massacres of 1894-1896 and the Armenian massacres during the Weltkrieg. These atrocities bolstered Armenian nationalism and strengthened the resistance movements. While some of these organisations, like the Fidayi, who tried to defend Armenian villages from Turkish and Kurdish pillagers, mainly strived for autonomy and security, others, like the Dashnaks, demanded the establishment of an independent Armenian state.\n\nThis dream of a free Armenia became a reality in 1918. After the Russian Empire collapsed, the Armenians used the resulting chaos to secede. However, about a year after we declared independence, the regional powers convened a conference in Kostantiniyye. The result: the Ottomans, Georgia, and Azerbaijan were to carve up Armenia between themselves. This agreement was the final blow for the First Republic of Armenia, which lacked the strength to defend itself against its neighbours.\n\nStill, our people did not lose hope. They continued to wait for the day they would finally be free, with some retreating to Karabakh to continue the resistance there. With the Middle East rising against the Sublime Porte and the Turks struggling to hold their own against the Arab forces, it seems that this day has finally come. Today we say enough! Throughout the country, volunteers are organising militias, and Turkish garrisons are getting disarmed. It is time to show the Ottomans that we cannot be so easily broken! For Armenia!"
 arm.39.d:9 "As it seems, the measures currently in place were just the beginning of Nzhdeh's efforts to shatter any resistance against the government. In his eyes, some people currently living inside our country will never be loyal subjects to his regime, and should thus be considered enemies of the state.\n\nToday, he introduced the 'Expulsion Act'. With this act, he wants to rid the nation of these 'Takanks' in order to bring our people stability and unity. It states that 'every Azeri and Turk is to leave the territory of the Armenian state within the span of three weeks. Should they refuse to leave within the given time span, the military will be authorised to expel them from their homes. Should they not comply, usage of force is permitted.'\n\nNaturally, this has sparked outrage among the Muslim population of the country, since Turks and Azeris alike now see themselves being prosecuted in the lands both they and their ancestors once called their home. However, the act did not only shock the Muslim parts of our population. Many Armenians are beginning to ask themselves if Nzhdeh really does what is right and if the expulsion of people they value as neighbours, friends and colleagues really is a necessary step to safeguard the future of the Armenian nation. Many still hope that Nzhdeh heeds the calls of the populace and decides to revoke the act before it unfolds its consequences, though a decision like this seems highly unlikely, especially since most of the military still blindly follows his orders and supports him and his measures without questions."

 assyria_events.1.d:9 "The Ma'dān, or Marsh Arabs, who inhabit the marshes near the city of Basra have long been a thorn in the side of central authority in the region just as their marshland home has been all but terra incognita for the Ottoman administration. Explorers who venture into their lands never return, and the Ma'dān who cooperate with outside authorities often find themselves severely punished by their local leaders in retaliation. The inhospitable nature of their marshes has, up until now, mostly ensured their autonomy, and their political apathy towards the Ottoman regime has kept them off the radar.\n\nRecent Assyrian damming and settlement projects made in an effort to develop new agricultural land and to flush out the Shiite resistance fighting the Assyrian settlers have forced them to take a more active stance; now, the Marsh Arabs are not only sheltering fugitives from Assyrian operations but also those of the Baghdadi Wali. The latter, angered by this development, has requested reinforcements from Kostantiniyye to bring them in line and impose both taxes and conscription for the Ottoman army."
 assyria_events.5.d:9 "Continuing to maintain that the Levies are the only thing between life and death for the Assyrian people, Rab Khaila Dawid d'Mar Shimun has rescinded the order from the Wali in Basra and has mobilised his troops. Backed by the Church of the East, Shimun has declared Basra an autonomous region within the empire and has demanded immediate withdrawal of the Wali's forces from the region, self-government for the Assyrian people, the right to collect taxes independently, and further protection of the Assyrian Church from Shiite discontent.\n\nThe Wali of Basra has, in response, mobilised the city's gendarmerie to disband the Levies, by force if necessary. However, he finds himself substantially outgunned and outnumbered within the city. In Kostantiniyye, the Grand Vizier is furious at this betrayal, and has demanded all Mesopotamian troops mobilised to put down the Assyrian insurrection before foreign intervention in their favour can occur."

While the aptly named Democratic Left did have presidential candidates before 1936, those were of middling importance and appeal, and could not even gather support among major unions. It would take a major shake-up in the political landscape of the labour movement as a whole to allow the broad front to gain traction, but if such a feat could be achieved, it could be a credible threat to the predatory crony capitalists who currently hold power in Brazil.§!\n"

A highly reactionary and nationalistic ideology, its Brazilian form is quite peculiar, for it preaches that the character of the nation is both Catholic and racially diverse, and as such faith and unity are Brazil's strength. It abhors democracy on principle, seeing it as weak, and the Republic as the reason for Brazil's fall from grace. While not openly monarchical at first, few doubt this aspect of their beliefs, considering the constant anti-republican rhetoric spouted by propaganda newspapers. The AIB, by far the most important integralist movement, is actually quite homogenous in nature, with especially large portions of its electorate being of colour, and even some 'revolutionary republicans' among its ranks.

Like the more influential and powerful Republicans, the Liberals are closer to a federation of parties that exist at a state level than a proper organisation with a unified vision and set of proposals. The fall of the old party chiefs swayed the balance of power among liberals away from the traditional centres, and thus many of the notables in the party are from South or Northeastern areas of Brazil. In general, they lack the apparatus and personnel the Republicans have used to share their names and their candidates with the common folk, even if they do have many newspapers and intellectuals favouring their party.

This simple goal grants it far larger adhesion than rival associations, and it enjoys relatively good membership in large cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Said large membership allows strikes to be powerful bargaining tools, and the frequent violent clashes have made the FAB and other socialist organisations associated with disorder and street battles in the public eye.§!\n"

Most of these orthodox syndicalists are either high ranking union figures or upper class intellectuals who seek to combat the extreme social inequality plaguing Brazil. The ideology's popularity is restricted, a consequence of its leadership's lack of political clout outside of labour circles.

In that time, the Reorganised Comrades Association - a group founded by supporters of Wang Jingwei (albeit without Wang's direct participation) has consolidated their grip over the party apparatus.\n\nThat being said, their singular rule over the Kuomintang has been challenged over the last decade or so.

This, combined with weakening communications with Wang's government in exile, has created a certain independence within MinGan cadres, even as the movement has reunited again.

The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a completely totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu.

The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the Radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the Radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a Moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the nature of class struggle in China or land reform.§!\n"

Believing in the notion of achieving total socialism by the workers and the peasantry, the PAC draws its name from its desire for the Kuomintang to take action as a revolutionary vanguard with the masses gaining revolutionary consciousness and taking action as well.\n\nThe main ideological facets of the PAC is a total social revolution through democratic land reform to reward the land to those who till it, the installation of local self-governments as a result, and the necessity for China to adopt a method of \"National Capitalism\" to transition China from a feudal society into a socialist one. While some members of PAC view the Third Internationale's extension into China as a potential threat to the native revolution practised in China, the PAC nonetheless has shown a willingness to work with members of the Orthodox Faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party as well as an equally beneficial relationship with the World Society. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen.§!\n"

These beliefs had received a major boost in credibility thanks to the successes of the Internationale, but the successive failures of the Xinhai Revolution has disillusioned many and the senior leadership of the League are largely content being the junior partner in the United Front.\n\nThey hope to use the Kuomintang revolution as a vehicle for their agenda, playing the long game towards Chinese Syndicalism.

In the meantime, they hope to ease tensions within the Kuomintang and steer their sister party away from authoritarianism, while also encouraging the mostly agrarian China to first industrialise in order to set the groundwork for a true syndicalist system.\n\nInternally, they have worked to preserve a compromise between council-based Marxists and the union-based syndicalists, mirroring the centrist faction in the French government.

These moderates, however, were happy to lash back, blaming radicalism and military rule for the disaster. They called for a total reregistration of Kuomintang members to expel warlords and their corrupt cronies, and founded a magazine known as the \"Reconstruction Review\" (Zaizao Xunkan), giving them their name.\n\nSuspicious of the RCA's Marxism and the PAC's radical leftist views, they have nonetheless accepted an uncomfortable alliance with the new government, often a \"third wheel\" in civilian affairs. Their power was and continues to be derived from their extensive contacts within the Overseas Chinese Commission (OCC), keeping the donations flowing from wealthy, nationalistic, and liberal Chinese and diaspora businessmen.\n\nThey are aided by an alliance with a smaller faction known as the \"India Clique\" of officers led by Sun family friend and former personal bodyguard Zhang Fakui.

 CHI_rca_moderate_party_long:9 "Kuomintang - Reorganised Comrades Association (Moderate Faction) - (Zhongguo Guomindang gaizu tongzhi hui - wenhe pai)\n§gThe Reorganised Comrades Association is a complex faction within the Kuomintang as, due to the size of its organisation and the ideological differences of its leaders, a weaker, moderate faction does exist within the RCA. This faction is led by Gu Mengyu; unlike the radicals of the RCA, they do not acknowledge Marxism, denouncing it as a form of metaphysics that is not grounded in scientific or empirical terms. As such they find themselves open to factions such as the Provisional Action Committee. To the Moderates, history is moved not by social factors but rather \"will\" that is the will for humans to overcome times of crisis and difficulties rather than by social and economic factors as those shown in the writings of the RCA-Radicals. Unlike the rigid formulae that seemed to be adopted by the Marxists of the radicals, reorganisation entails creating a new form of revolutionary.\n\nGu believes that the RCA is to guide the masses cautiously unlike the radicals who believe in the omnipotence of the mass movement. The Kuomintang should be a revolution that belongs to all peoples, not just to the workers and peasants as expressed by the Radicals. As a result they choose to distance themselves from the radicals' emphasis on the masses. To the Moderates, the masses may carry a relentless revolutionary power - one that may forfeit the revolution.

The Radical Faction distances itself from the Moderates with their views on class struggle and Marxist historical materialism. While few members of the RCA are willing to outwardly declare themselves as Marxists, their writings exhibit a strong Marxist influence and members of the radicals frequently use phrases such as \"contradiction\" and \"totality\".\n\nThe ranks of the Radical Faction are full of former syndicalists and they are often associated with the Chinese Syndicalist Party's Radical Faction. Members of the Radical Faction of the RCA espouse in what they believe to be a \"Materialist\" interpretation of the Three Principles' of the People - that is the belief that the sanminzhuyi can be interpreted through the lenses of Marxism and that economic factors can be used to explore Chinese history. Sharing the views of the moderates, the Radicals do believe that a reorganisation is needed to expel the degeneracy that has pervaded into the Kuomintang. However, the party must thus be linked with the masses and that the Kuomintang has an organisation must be turned into one for the workers and peasants, - eventually becoming so ingrained that the revolution will be led by workers and peasants.

He then entered the Agricultural School of Anhui Province which was founded by the revolutionary Zhu Yunshan, who had a profound influence on the school's students - introducing many progressive journals and books. He was also highly influenced by his teacher Qian Xinchun, who would teach Chen Shaoyu about famous leaders such as the martyr Vladimir Lenin and Chen Duxiu. During his school years, he became highly active in the political movement and led boycotts against Japanese and German products and corrupt elections. He formally joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party in the summer of 1924 and participated in the May 30th Movement on the eve of the Northern Expedition.\n\nAfter the expedition's failure, the newly organised League of Chinese Syndicalists sent Chen Shaoyu to study at the Sun Yat-sen University in Montargis, France, where he was able to master the French language and became enamoured with the \"ultra-syndicalism\" movement within the Commune of France. It was here that he became a leader of the more radical members of the Chinese syndicalist revolution, those that believe that the revolution must be handled by the workers and unions in its true orthodox form. The radical tone of these politically ambitious and younger Chinese syndicalists has earned them the moniker of being the \"Radical\" faction and their presence represents some of the tensions that permeated both the League of Chinese Syndicalists and the fragile united front with the Kuomintang.\n\nAfter a tumultuous opening of the National People's Congress, CSP Radicals staged a soft coup that allowed them to force out their more moderate \"Orthodox\" rivals, setting the stage for Chen to take control of the fledging government.§!"

He entered Guangdong's military academy in 1912 and then served as Sun Yat-sen's personal bodyguard. During his time in the military academy, his classmates included Xue Yue and Ye Ting. In 1922, when Chen Jiongming ousted Sun, Zhang displayed his loyalty to Sun by refusing to surrender and continued to fight in Guangxi.\n\nWhen Sun returned in 1923, Zhang raised troops to drive out Chen Jiongming and helped establish a new revolutionary government. During the Northern Expedition, his leadership of the Cantonese dominated Fourth army earned him the reputation as the \"Hero of the Iron Army\".\n\nForced to retreat when the Kuomintang lost the expedition, he joined with Sun Fo and his centre-right Reconstruction faction abroad rather than go to Europe, deepening his friendship with Sun and Xue Yue. As part of deal brokered with Wang's central committee, he was given a position as leader of a Chinese military attaché in Calcutta in 1934, building ties with Indian commanders and growing close to members of the Indochinese VNQDD he instructed.

Despite their fantastic wealth, Chen decided to escape an arranged marriage and fled to join the army at age 13. Disgusted by warlordism, he initially left military service to become a railway receptionist before finding his way to Whampoa military academy.\n\nConsidered one of the \"Three Most Outstanding Graduates of Whampoa\" alongside He Zhonghan and the now-deceased Jiang Xianyun, Chen became a protege of Chiang Kai-shek. He led a company responsible for the Marshal's personal protection. During the Eastern Expedition in 1925, Chen talked Chiang out of committing suicide after a major defeat, carrying the general on his back for nearly 10km. This won him the lasting respect of Chiang, despite their political disagreements.\n\nThe failure of the Northern Expedition put a new twist in Chen's career. Sent to Europe for intelligence training, he came back to participate in the 1932 Shanghai uprising where he was wounded. Hiding under the name \"Wang Yong\", he was successfully evacuated. In addition to his regular duties leading the conventional army, Chen has also been active in military intelligence, growing closer to Zhou Enlai. He has proven an effective ambusher, moving his forces swiftly and attacking his opponents at key weak points.§!\n\n§YNotes: One of Zhou Enlai's chief deputies in the Red Squad, Chen is heavily tied to the so-called \"Political Department clique\" affiliated with the RCA.§!"

He briefly participated in tail end of the old Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement before enrolling in the Federal Military School (the renamed Saint-Cyr). By 1922, he had formally joined the Chinese Syndicalist party founded two years prior.\n\nXiao returned home in turn to a changed China. By 1924, the Warlord Era was in full swing and Xiao's first assignment was to help organise the Anyuan road and mine workers strike, one of the CSP's first revolutionary actions. Afterwards he became a political officer, fighting in the doomed Northern Expedition.\n\nIn its aftermath, he initially was recalled to Europe for further studies to prepare him to become a senior officer. In 1932, after the Shanghai Uprising, he was smuggled back into the MinGan Zone and proved to be an effective guerilla - going so far as to publish articles on the subject. He is also a talented organiser, capable of keeping the insurgency supplied despite all odds. Armed with an open mind, he has also avoided needless friction with any of the National Revolutionary Army's warring cliques.

In the spring of 1919, Xu entered Shanxi's Provincial National Normal School, where he received his education. After hearing of Sun Yat-sen's newly established Whampoa Military Academy in 1924, he headed southwards from Shanghai alongside other Shanxi natives to participate in Whampoa's first graduating class.\n\nXu's service in the National Revolutionary Army began as one of Sun Yat-sen's bodyguards, and he participated in the pacification of the Merchant Corps. He also served in the Eastern Expeditions against Chen Jiongming and the subsequent ill-fated Northern Expedition. After the NRA's defeat in the Northern Expedition, he fled alongside other generals of the Kuomintang's left wing for the MinGan insurgent zone, where he got a taste of the Kuomintang's decade-long guerrilla war.\n\nAfter the failure of the 1932 Shanghai uprising, he just barely survived to be extracted to go to Europe.

He instead travelled overseas to the newly proclaimed Commune of France where he met fellow leftists, socialists, and syndicalists such as Cai Hesen, Cai Chang, and Deng Xiaoping. He then participated in the Work-Study Programme where he worked in French factories but in 1921, he left France to study at the Chemical Engineering Department at the Université du Travail in Belgium. During his stay in Belgium, he gradually turned further to the left and joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nIn 1924, he joined the Chinese Kuomintang and served as the director of the Kuomintang's communications department in Paris. It was around this time, that he attended the military school in Saint-Cyr and in 1925, he returned to China with French aid and weapons to aid in the Northern Expedition. He served under Zhou Enlai in the Political Department, where he essentially acted as Zhou's protege.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition failed, Nie served under Zhou in the initial stages of the insurgency before being evacuated to Europe after the 1932 uprising.

As leading members of the Kuomintang, Dai Jitao and Chiang Kai-shek (who were so close that they were practically brothers) had to flee to Japan to escape the reach of the Beiyang Government. The young Wei-kuo was essentially raised by Chiang and Chiang's concubine Yao Yecheng, and thus he was adopted into Chiang's family, especially as Chiang's mother missed her deceased youngest son Chiang Ruiqing deeply. As a sign of national dedication, both of the late Marshal's sons were named after the nation (kuo): Wei means latitude while Ching (his brother) means longitude.\n\nA young Chiang Wei-kuo grew up next to Whampoa with his father. However, tragedy struck the Chiang household with the collapse of the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition. After Chiang's assassination, Chiang Wei-kuo fled abroad to join his brother Chiang Ching-kuo in Europe who was then studying at Sun Yat-sen University in Paris.\n\nAbroad he and his brother received extensive support from many of their father's former students and friends, with the younger man being particularly enamoured by this increasingly radicalised clique of Whampoa graduates. In 1935 he joined the military, receiving training initially as an infantry cadet with the chasseurs alpins. Still in training when the League War began, he utilised his connections to secure a position as a non-commissioned officer in the British Republican tank corps.\n\nComing home, he has formally joined the NRA - hoping to use the skills and ideas he learned overseas to help pave the way for the NRA's first mechanised divisions.

He, like many of his fellow classmates in exile, felt betrayed by the Expedition's failure and sought targets to blame. Inducted into an underground alumni group of like-minded cadets led by Hu Zongnan, he fell into a smaller camp led by He Zhonghan and Deng Wenyi. They not only blamed the reactionary forces of the north and the German imperialists for the expedition's failure, but also the rampant disorganisation and incompetence of the Kuomintang's bureaucracy - which in their eyes sabotaged the National Revolutionary Army from within.\n\nOne of the more intellectually oriented members of the China Revival Society, Liu's extremist writings - incorporating ideas from Europe's Totalist Charter - has made him an object of controversy, but also a media darling for those advocating for a much more militarised revolution.§!\n\n§YNotes: A member of the CRS and the smaller Revolutionary Army Comrades Association, he is in many ways the mouthpiece of the otherwise secretive CRS.

Born to overseas Chinese in Trinidad and Tobago, the Chen family rarely spoke Chinese and indulged themselves in the literary world of English writers.

Inspired by the revolutionary leader, he decided to commit his life to the cause of the Chinese Revolution. He took the Trans-Siberian Railroad to China and ran into Malaysian doctor Wu Lien-te. Upon learning that Chen lacked a Chinese name, Lien-te gave him the name \"Youren\", as the equivalent of Eugene.\n\nA tactful diplomat, Chen was instrumental in securing the Third Internationale's recognition of the Kuomintang as the competing revolutionary government of China in the 1920s, and their continued support after the Northern Expedition.

At once both a brawling, vice-filled troublemaker and a prodigious student (first in his class), he studied to be a teacher but was expelled for theft. He then became a gambler, but was caught cheating and severely beaten. He also tried a variety of other careers before attempting to be a militiaman, flunking out of that as well.\n\nHe then tried to become a Shanghai gangster, meeting Du Yuesheng and Yang Hu and serving as a low level attendant who was often unemployed. At age 30, he seemed to be a failure, \"living off the land\" (and mooching off his cousin), if it wasn't for suddenly meeting with a small group of revolutionaries. This \"Shanghai group\" consisted of fellow Zhejiangers Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Jitao, and Chen Guofu. Perhaps because of them, or because of his connections in organised crime, he became a student at Whampoa.\n\nA bat-man for Chiang, he tried to make himself useful by absorbing information from his classmates. A cavalry cadet, he spent so much time spying that he never actually finished his coursework. He shed his flamboyant personality in favour of silence.\n\nThis served him well after the Northern Expedition failed.

 CHI.midgame.014.d:9 "In the dead of night, near a discreet villa, a young and somewhat inebriated officer approaches. He is a faceless man, deliberately wearing a drab, monotonous outfit calculated to prevent the man from standing out as he conducts the \"labour of hound and horse\" as he so calls it. He carries with him a proposition from his master.\n\nInside is one of the fledging Republic's most eminent figures, perhaps the third most influential figure in the old MinGan insurgency. The circumstances are grim and he shoos out his hand-picked guards from the meeting room. He is not fooled by his guest's act, watching the man's wolfish eyes dart around for weakness as he speaks.\n\nIn the paranoid atmosphere that permeates the land, conspiracies and furtive meetings are all too common. But this perhaps eclipses all others in its scale - a plot against the leader of the very party they claim to serve. Dai Chunfeng, the guest, begins by reminding General Deng Yanda of their common struggle together in the insurgency, which soon devolves into a rant about how the Paris Committee has swooped in to steal all the glory despite hiding in safety for nearly a decade. He insists he and other officers are willing to fight to protect the revolution from Wang's folly and proposes an alliance with unspecified conditions against him. He is already armed with potential areas of coordination between their respective factions.\n\nDeng is quick to show his annoyance at Dai equating his efforts to those of the insurgency barely concealing his disdain for the former gangster. He is well aware who Dai serves - Hu Zongnan and his clique have long been undermining Deng's authority within the army. But as the Chairman's power grows, the threat of tyranny hangs over the nation and there is some temptation towards the use of \"special methods\" to keep the RCA at bay. As the veteran general stares down the \"officer\" who failed to graduate Whampoa with flaring contempt, he nonetheless contemplates his own labour of hound and horse for Song Qingling and the PAC."
 CHI.midgame.600.d:9 "In 1927, the Chinese revolution came to an abrupt halt when German intervention helped tilt the scales in favour of reactionary forces in the nation, dashing the hopes of idealists and socialists throughout the land. The Kuomintang and the League of Chinese Syndicalists were scatter to the winds, and the National Revolutionary Army broken.\n\nThis however, was not the end. The NRA proved its valour on the battlefield, a disciplined army trained by experienced socialist officers and educated in socialist doctrine. Initially led by Red Russian émigrés, the Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine expanded to include officers from around the Internationale.\n\nBetween 1927-1936, the MMIC continued to train exiled NRA forces, creating a small but elite standing force of Chinese revolutionaries. Chinese operatives were periodically smuggled in and out of China, joining underground resistance movements.\n\nThanks to the inevitable instability caused by capitalist exploitation, the Chinese people finally gained another chance to break their shackles. In a daring, lighting revolt they overran much of China's eastern coastline, creating the revived National Revolutionary Government for which to challenge reactionary rule. The MMIC has been sent to assist them along their revolutionary path. They have eagerly written back home with giddy anticipation, with high hopes for China's future (and their own)."
 CHI.midgame.816.d:9 "Associated with the blooming in late winter and early spring to herald the end of the winter months,for centuries, \"Prunus Mume\" or the Chinese plum has long been a venerated flower in Sinospheric countries. During the Ming and Qing eras of rule, the mudan (paeonia suffruiicosa) was refered to as the national flower and indeed its imagery can still be found amongst the tattered banners of the defeated Zhili and Beiyang armies.\n\nWhile proposals such as the Chrysanthemum have also been voiced, the Kuomintang's Ceremony and Uniform Review Committee of the Ministry of the Interior has proposed that the plum blossom should be the national flower of the young republic. Known as the meihua, the plum blossom is a symbol of utmost resilence and preservence in the face of adversity, because the plum blossoms bloom most vibrantly even amidst the harsh winter snow. This imagery resonates well with many Kuomintang members as the past decade of party leadership has seen the party rise from a scattered and splintered movement to finally achieving national unification. The plum tree can also grow for a long time and its longevity is cited by many who are in favour of the meihua as the national flower, as the Party's dedication and longevity to carry out Dr. Sun's revolution. The three stamens represent Dr. Sun's Three Principles while the five petals symbolise the five branches of the government.\nIn collaboration with the Ministry of Finance (in order to print banknotes with the plum blossom on it), the Central Executive Committee has come together and has officially adopted the plum blossom as the symbol of a new young blossoming socialist republic."
 CHI.lategame.065.d:9 "When he was deposed as a child in 1912 and put into de facto house arrest in the Forbidden City, few thought Puyi would ever be a threat. After all, the monarchy was deeply unpopular and the fledging Republic had far more pressing problems to deal with than a hapless toddler. But alas, strongmen came and went starting with Yuan Shikai, and many ignorantly attempted to hoist a monarchy onto the people. The Germans, in all their arrogance, insisted on restoring Puyi to his so-called \"birthright\", as if the snuffing out of the Xinhai dream could be any more complete.\n\nBut the republican dream of freedom did not die with the end of the Northern Expedition. And now, with our Republic at last restored across China, this leaves one final matter to attend to as we turn the page in China's story. Puyi has grown into a vile, wicked man - taught little practical skills and a sadistic, childish personality. Or so our propaganda says. The reality is the man has been a puppet his entire life, and [CHI.GetLeader] has already ruled out a public execution of the deposed Emperor as excessive. There is little for our government to gain besides unneeded comparisons to Lenin. So there remain a few options.\n\nThe first would be to simply exile him to whichever state is willing to take him in. While this would effectively wash our government's hands of this matter, some question if this would pose a major security risk. Another possibility is to order him confined in the Forbidden City under house arrest, keeping him out of sight until he dies forgotten. Many however feel this is too similar to the unpopular articles written after Puyi's first abdication, and also allows for the effective embodiment of reactionary evil to go unpunished for his treasonous deeds. The final, and perhaps most radical proposal, would be to attempt to rehabilitate Puyi. This would entail a substantive effort to retrain the man to live like his fellow citizens as another comrade in a larger revolution."

Johns stepped up to the stage to attack Upton Sinclair on several grounds - the first of which is that Sinclair's administration has decimated the fuel industry due to his opposition to oil drilling, resulting in domestic fuel shortages. Sinclair retorted that his administration is already working on improving fuel efficiency for military purposes, and that he is by no means blind to the fuel shortages, only for Johns to blast him for being idealistic in a time of public need.

The selection of what many perceive as a symbol of the old American elite has created a media frenzy so large that it would make the notorious William Randolph Hearst blush - indeed, the campaign quickly ended up being as much about Roosevelt as it was about the President. The WPA leadership stuck to their guns, however, touting Roosevelt's history of activism, championing the needs of the working-class. The hope seems to be that Roosevelt can muster a coalition of Sinclair opposition, women, African-Americans, and reformists - but whether she can find enough credibility among both the Syndicalist and non-Syndicalist base to make this progressive alliance possible is a very open question.\n\nRoosevelt and the WPA attacked Sinclair on several grounds - the first of which was Sinclair's opposition to oil drilling, which they argued is causing fuel shortages. Sinclair retorted that his administration is not blind to the shortages and is already working on improving fuel efficiency for military purposes, and that oil drilling is not necessary.

 csa.71.d:9 "Demand for food to feed the armies and citizens of a starving, war-torn Europe led many commercially-minded Southern landowners to grow corn and wheat during the years of the Weltkrieg. For nearly a decade, sales to Europe during and after the war made landowners, bankers, and commercial insurers rich, but this prosperity would not last. In 1925, the British Revolution wracked the United Kingdom, precipitating a debt crisis as scores of Britons lost their lives' savings and as even the British government went into a de-facto default, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. To make matters worse for the South, the recovery of the German agricultural sector following demobilisation caused demand for food crops to plummet even further.\n\nThe tenant farmers who had worked the land for the landowners that had profited during the high times responded by unionising during the lows. With some encouragement from Norman Thomas, sharecropper and gas-station worker Harry Leland Mitchell and his friend Clay East formed the Southern Tenants Farmers' Union in 1934, eventually coming to affiliate with the AFL-CIO. However, during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution, many members of the STFU were taken in by Huey Long's populist rhetoric, and openly supported the America Firsters. Since the end of the Second American Civil War, the STFU has only continued to attract Longists and other seditious elements seeking to use it as a cover to legitimise their presence in the new America.\n\nToday, however, the STFU met its fate before the unions as a bailiff presented Mitchell and East to a union court on charges of sedition, high treason, and harbouring reactionaries and crypto-Longists such as Francis Townsend, one of the chief architects of Long's \"Share Our Wealth\" program and who was found by the CIA in Tyronza, Arkansas after East confessed to CIA agents that he had harboured Townsend and his wife at his home.\n\nPresident Browder, for his part, is said to be privately ecstatic at finally having the chance to destroy such a dangerous pocket of resistance as he turns the increasingly mighty state apparatus of the Union of Socialist American States to the task of dismantling the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union and turning their lands directly to the purposes of the state."

The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The main protagonist Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma.

Word has it that the Greek government is already preparing a statement concerning the matter, but many fear that Greece will shun away from direct intervention, fearful of the much superior Turkish army and navy."

 den.1020.d:9 "Banners titled 'Danmark for Folket' (Denmark for the People) among other things were hung around several governmental institutions in Copenhagen today as Thorvald Stauning prepares a new speech which has garnered attention from across the spectrum. He has announced that Socialdemokratiet, as a party must undergo change and modernisation as the world shifts around them; thus, he has unveiled a new program dedicated to transforming Socialdemokratiet into a true party for the Danish people. This year's party congress for Socialdemokratiet was abuzz with attention as a new committee was founded to review the program of principles first set in stone in 1913. This committee consists of party members, the trade union movement, and the cooperative, hoping to craft several principles and programs that will both secure Danish democracy and effectively aid in bringing Denmark out of this economic crisis.\n\nStauning declared in a speech that growing revanchism from the east and west—from the International's syndicalist militias to the once dominant Russian hegemon now crushed under the German thumb for decades—will only push for the destruction of harmony in Europe. As such, a Denmark under Stauning and Socialdemokratiet will seek to unite the workers and peasants, as well as the capital and workers.

Characterised by their studies abroad in Britain and France, the Kommunarder Clique is a select faction of older communist figures, including Nexø as well as figures such as Børge Houmann and Alfred Jensen. Their ideals develop around the idea that Denmark should be transformed into a means for the Scandinavian revolution to flourish and that Denmark should transform itself into an outpost for the revolution. Alongside this, the Kommunarder Clique advocates for a centralisation of the state and for the sycophancy of the party to the state to achieve this final solution. Not only will Denmark's workers fight for their own liberation, so too shall they fight to liberate workers across Europe as well.

The party had initially been led by Marie Sophie-Nielsen as well as Thøger Thøgersen, who broke away from Socialdemokratiet in the wake of the chaos of the tumultuous revolutions across Europe, and is now solely piloted by Larsen, with Thøgersen supporting him heavily. While the party holds in some regard other members who broke from Socialdemokratiet who advocate for republicanism, DVSP has taken on a stance of supporting workers' councils as the primary means for power in the nation. Larsen, though, is not liked by much of Føderationen and has shown signs of wanting to dissolve the party and place the DVSP as the sole mass party for Danish workers and citizens to support.

Christian Christensen, leader of the Fagopposition Samenslutning, and former social democrat, has long led this so-called 'union of unions', wanting to organise trade unions across the country into one big union which would operate and manage the desires and freedoms of workers with great efficiency. Conciliatory and compromising, Christensen and the FS are well liked by most but disliked by Larsen due to his desire for true trade union dominance over the country. On the other hand, young firebrand Richard Jensen emerges, representing the young guard and is held in high regard by those in the navy, especially as he chairs Søfyrbødernes Forbund, the chief union for sailors and seamen. He too came from a poor upbringing, working in the navy, and has represented his desires to elevate seamen for the tough job they perform and for the great disdain for how little attention is placed upon them.

Founded popularly as Socialdemokratisk Forbund, many refer to the party as Socialdemokratiet instead, having been founded in the wake of Denmark's industrialisation and the desire for a democratic and socialist party for these new workers. However, it was not until Thorvald Stauning's ascension in 1924, in the wake of Radikale Venstre's failure in government and a caretaker conservative government being appointed, that Socialdemokratiet rose in popularity, also appointing the world's first female minister, Nina Bang. For the past decade, Stauning has alleviated tensions with the left in his desire to create a welfare state, in a coalition with Radikale Venstre, steering the course for Denmark's continued prosperity. Long having advocated for increased rights for workers, universal healthcare, female suffrage, and several new pensions, much of Denmark stands in accordance with Socialdemokratiet's continued dominance.§!\n"

Despite their clash with the conservative party Højre in the late nineteenth century, the Liberals now sits alongside Det Konservative Folkeparti in a centre-right coalition to oppose the dominance of the 'Socials.' Espousing ideals of classically liberal economic policies such as support for the free market, Venstre is seen as a party unable to keep up with the times and as such sees limited support outside of a coalition with the KF.§!\n"

Once the dominant party in this coalition, the widely unpopular wartime policies of Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle have left the party playing second fiddle to Socialdemokratiet. Still happy to support Stauning in his quest to create a welfare state, the Social Liberals are now led by Peter Munch, who presides over a party inclined economically by thinkers such as Henry George and John Stuart Mill, and a cautious view of social reform marred by a strong tie to demilitarisation.§!\n"

While hardly one of the dominant parties in the 1920s, the KF succesfully used its entrenchment in the upper house to block Stauning's more radical policies. One of its core tenets is to stand against the spread of socialism, a position the party has hardened since the British Revolution.\n\nConservative leader John Christmas Møller had long been detracting support from Stauning through labour reforms and activism for workers' rights, but many are growing wary of his counciliatory measures. Though this 'red scare' has inspired a resurgence of conservatism in Danish society, the KF is currently far from the levers of power, and even its one-time partner Venstre does not see eye-to-eye with its policy of rearmament 'to take the fight abroad', and so the KF sees itself alone in campaigning against Peter Munch's antimilitarist rhetoric and advocating for the necessary militarisation and investment into the army.§!\n"

Led by Victor Pürschel, the autocratic wing of KF espouses a desire to reinvigorate power to King Christian X and also to consolidate Denmark around a single-party state whose Prime Minister is selected by the king, similar to the German system. This party does not nominally seek the abolishment of elections but rather wishes to control the means of the state and dominate politics, though Pürschel is quite open to the idea of Denmark being safe from the ills of socialism and as well as the destructive influence of letting the people decide the fate of the country.

In exchange for rigorous anti-socialist laws as well as continuing the grand liberal economic ambitions that Madsen-Mygdal has been eager to add to his party's program, Møller has convinced him that a unicameral parliament should be instituted. Despite the dominance of the liberals and conservatives in the upper house, Møller has long clamored for an end to what has been, for decades, a rubber stamp obstructing progress for reform.

 DEN_thomas_madsen_mygdal_leader_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §LDecember 24th, 1876, in Hjørring, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LMygdal originally pursued a degree in education but subsequently withdrew from the program and enrolled in an agricultural school. He subsequently assumed the role of instructor at Dalum Agricultural School and subsequently served as principal from 1908 to 1920. In a manner similar to his father, Madsen-Mygdal joined the Radikale Venstre party at the outset of the First World War, requesting that he be appointed Minister of Agriculture. However, Prime Minister Zahle rejected this request, and in part due to disagreement with the government's regulatory policy, Madsen-Mygdal subsequently left the party. His desire for pure liberalism within Denmark, alongside the enshrinement of agriculture as Denmark's main industry, propelled his popularity within Venstre, the leading liberal party of the time. Madsen-Mygdal was concerned about the influence of state intervention in the economy and largely advocated for the market to stay as free as possible, decrying trade unions to be abhorrent.\n\nIn 1924, after the defeat of Niels Neergard's right-wing coalition comprising Venstre and KF, Madsen-Mygdal was approved as the official leader of the opposition. Under his stewardship, Venstre approved several trade deals with Germany and paved the way for several agricultural reforms. When Thorvald Stauning's government failed to pass a budget for 1927, snap elections were called in December of 1926, after which Madsen-Mygdal formed a government for the first time, though only for a single term. His term was marred by great resentment from the working class as Madsen-Mygdal sought to empower the Danish Krone by reducing wages and easing up on social costs.\n\nIn 1930, Madsen-Mygdal lost the bid for a second term after a disagreement with the brand new KF leader, John Christmas Møller, who found the subordination of the conservatives to Venstre detestable and vetoed the passing of a new Finance Act. Despite leading from the opposition into the 1930s, Madsen-Mygdal is a pragmatic man willing to support the rural population and address their needs despite the growing labour movement, which has since trounced a lot of his popular support.§!\n\n§YNotes: Madsen-Mygdal popularly said, 'Let fall what cannot stand' in regards to the free market, which sums up his classically liberal attitude.§!"

Maximism itself is rooted in Sorelian rhetoric but has also developed an independent doctrine and drawn inspiration from French Neosocialists.

While seen with some suspicion, the SDP have avoided crackdowns for being focused on economic theorising and discussion over political agitation.

The de-facto 'third party' of the Union, the Liberals did well in 1931, scaring the syndicalist establishment, but their successes ended swiftly with the Parliamentary Crisis. Triggering a constitutional crisis with other members of the 'Second UDC', the ILP and NDP, the party fell alongside them.

 ENG_market_liberal_party_long:9 "Liberal Party - Constitutionalists\n§gWhile the post-Revolution Liberal Party largely tacked to the left, this shift opened up a great divide with classically and conservative minded Liberals who hadn't boarded the boats to Canada. These liberal-conservative 'Constitutionalists' instead took an openly anti-socialist political line, while pledging to uphold the morals of the 'British Constitution'. Small in number and operating almost as a party unto their own within the Liberal Party, the fringe fell under constant suspicion of almost certainly being an entryist front for royalist subversives. Constitutionalist candidates would face often violent protests by Labour members, tainting the Samuelites by association. The Mond Affair in late 1931, wherein faction grandee Abraham England was proven to be in contact with the late Jewish financier, spelled their doom. Raids and arrests scattered the Constitutionalists, whose remnants fled to Ireland to avoid treason charges.§!\n"

Bringing together many conservative splinters and independents, the NDP stood as a fresh face encompassing the right-wing of the post revolution order, having repudiated aristocratic Toryism to subscribe to Macmillan's brand of syncretic corporatism. The NDP was expressly loyal to the Republic, but some believed them to be an electoral vehicle for reactionaries. The NDP was at the heart of the Parliamentary Crisis, with perhaps unfounded paranoia growing over Macmillan's movement after he tried to affiliate with Labour, before getting rejected after a militant rebellion and joining the 'Second UDC'. While Deputy Chairman Oswald Mosley interned Macmillan and his associates soon after, the idea of 'constructive republican conservatism' still informs a number of Congressional independents who escaped arrest.§!\n"

Led by the old agrarian independent Herbert Matthews, the Rural Party ties a syncretic redistributionist ideology around a fierce defence of rural interests and smallholders within the often urban-biased syndicalist system. Though openly aloof to national political debate, the Ruralists have become notorious for the suspected harbouring of royalists in their local branches, following a rumoured entryist push by the CRGB to seed agents within the party.

 fer.80.d:9 "The first proper elections under Semyonov's rule over all of Russia ended in a great victory for Semyonov's own party, the All-Russian Popular Party (VNP). This party unites people from all sides of politics, championing a nationalist, populist, and conservative program. With all separatist, communist, Svobodnik, and other terroristic parties banned, turnout was quite low. There were some mass protests, but they were broken up by the Cossacks, and the day of the election went relatively smoothly. By the end of the day, the VNP gained a majority with its minor allies, facing little serious challenge. The Kadets became the main opposition party in the Duma, but even they seem accepting of Semyonov's regime, no doubt understanding that it is a better way to moderate the regime to take part in it rather than fight it. Semyonov was subsequently elected as President, and a new cabinet, again led by Chairman-Minister Sergey Tashkin, was appointed."
 fer.82.d:9 "The All-Russian Popular Party (VNP) is Semyonov's key to Russian politics. Their press and street campaigns are vast, and they all seek to portray what a great man Grigory Semyonov is, and how decades of Kolchakite propaganda about his warlordism were merely lies. In these pamphlets and speeches, Semyonov is portrayed as the liberator, the saviour of Russian freedoms, the stalwart enemy of Savinkov and socialism. The VNP's vast campaign budget is often used to host generous events such as soup kitchens for the poor and musical concerts for the elites of the cities.\n\nOh, and what do they believe in? It is of secondary concern. They stand for all Russian people. In practice, their program is vaguely conservative, somewhat populist, and most of all, loyal to the Ataman."

'Liga Patriótica Argentina', as they called themselves, were responsible for the murder of hundreds of striking workers. In 1921 and 1922, during the rebellion in Patagonia, LPA forces caused gruesome acts of violence against strikers both in Patagonia and during a general strike in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1930 Liga participated in Uriburu's coup, who, with the support of the army and the LPA, ousted the government and installed a corporatist, ultranationalist military dictatorship. In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca became the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians. Carlés took advantage of the popular outrage and launched a coup d'état on the 24th of December 1935 when Liga with the support of navy and parts of the military captured the capital.\n\nThe LPA sees the salvation of Argentina, the return to former greatness and the removal of all hostile elements as their primary goal; they act extremely populist on the outside, claiming to serve the Argentinian people for a greater good.\n\nFounded: §Y1919§!\nIdeology:\n- National populism\n- Corporatist capitalism\n- Nationalism§!\n"

 FOP_market_liberal_party_long:9 "Partido Demócrata Nacional\n§gThe PDN (PNA until 1932) was one of Argentina's oldest political parties and closely connected to the Roca family, who provided two Argentinian Presidents in the last 50 years: Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (1880-1886, 1898-1904) and Julio Argentino Pascual Roca (1932-1935).\n\nIt was created on March 15th, 1874, after the union of the Autonomist Party and the National Party. It was since its inception a highly important party, and the Roca family became very influential within the party, with Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz becoming a president in 1880-1886 and 1898-1904. It later became the bedrock of la edad de oro (1880 - 1916), boasting a booming economy and a flood of immigrants from Europe which strengthened Argentina's industry, becoming one of the most prosperous contries in the world before the Weltkrieg. Meanwhile, its main rival became the Radical Civic Union (UCR). It was criticised for its use of election fraud, which lead to PNA dissolving with its members joining Conservative Party and the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nFollowing Uriburu's death in early 1932, the PNA was reborn as Partido Demócrata Nacional (PDN) for the upcoming 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca being its leader, and PDN, thanks to electoral fraud, won by a landslide. Roca was inaugurated president, and he promised to find a compromise with their syndicalist neighbours Patagonia and Chile. Although many hoped that Roca would bring back the good old times and strengthen Argentina's position globally, this did not happen.\n\nAlthough he took a less radical course than Uriburu and developed plans to recapture the lost territories at Patagonia, launching small skirmishes into FOP territory and successfully retaking Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego thanks to the navy, he scrapped plans to send the army into Patagonian core territory, deciding to focus more on improving the economy. Roca's takeover disgruntled the military and the LPA, and due to his political liberalisation, rumours started to spread in 1935 that there would be an imminent peace settlement with the Patagonians, causing outrage across the nation. This was enough for Carlés and the LPA to launch a coup on Christmas day, putting Roca and his ministers under temporary house arrest as Carlés proclaimed himself President.\n\nFounded: §Y1932§!\nIdeology:\n- Economic liberalism\n- Conservative liberalism§!\n"
 FOP_social_liberal_party_long:9 "Unión Cívica Radical\n§gFounded on June 26th, 1891, the party quickly became influential over Argentine politics, causing the 1893 Radical Revolution and the 1905 Radical Revolution, which later led to reform in terms of election fraud. Two presidents of Argentina to be part of the Radical Civic Union were §YHipólito Yrigoyen§! and §YMarcelo Torcuato de Alvear§!.\n\nIn 1916 the Argentine General Election took place, being the first where the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was implemented, establishing universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage. Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR, ended up winning the elections.\n\nHis tumultous presidency between 1916 - 1922, with the secession of Patagonia, had Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear replace him as the UCR candidate for the 1922 elections, which he won. Argentina saw slight economic improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of April 1925. Despite this, Alvear ordered the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. This increased morale and trust in the government, but led to the radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion, and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy.\n\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was surprisingly appointed as the Radical Civic's Union candidate for the general elections instead of the current and relatively popular Marcelo Alvear. Despite this, Yrigoyen won by a large margin, which led many to speculate that it was due to election fraud.\n\nYrigoyen's most important opposition was the military, which started planning a coup against him. This eventually happened on September 6th, 1930, as Uriburu, with support from Carlés and the LPA, took over and proclaimed himself president of Argentina, banning political parties, arresting democratic politicians and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Yrigoyen's supporters, called Yrigoyenists, were tortured alongside other political opponents of his regime. Yrigoyen himself was held under arrest at the Martín García Island.\n\nUriburu eventually died in early 1932, and Argentina went back to democracy under conservative politician Julio Argentino Pascual Roca.\n\nFounded: §Y1891§!\nIdeology:\n- Liberalism\n- Radicalism\n- Democracy§!\n"

In the aftermath of Georgian independence, the party mellowed its views to avoid censorship and suppression, and fear of drawing ire from the German hegemon.

In the late 19th century three groups emerged, fittingly dubbed the First, Second and Third Group, each with different ideas for how Georgian independence should be achieved. The Third Group, under the leadership of Noe Zhordania and Irakli Tsereteli embraced Marxist ideology and sought to meld Georgian nationalism with socialist beliefs. In 1903 the second crisis erupted, when the Third Group voted to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, despite the protests of prominent members like Noe Zhordania. This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party. Zhordania emerged as the leader of the newly dubbed SSDP and helped establish an independent Georgian republic, guided by a mixture of socialism, humanism and nationalism, whilst rejecting the more extreme Bolshevik currents that had swept across the Eurasian labour movement.§!\n"

A critical moment emerged when the party leadership embraced violent revolutionary struggle, in line with the Socialist Revolutionaries' “Combat Organisation”, and began to endorse expropriations and violent reprisals against unjust landowners, despite condemnation from Georgian conservatives. This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPSP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats.

As one of Germany's most powerful businessmen and press barons, Hugenberg is in charge of the gigantic "Hugenberg Group", a media empire controlling newspapers, publishers and advertising agencies across the Empire - their papers sell hundreds of thousands of copies and hold considerable sway on public opinion. Of course, their articles are biased towards Hugenberg's preferred beliefs, rabid anti-Socialism and anti-Semitism.\n\nThe 1936 electoral campaign has given the DVLP hope that they can position themselves as the leader of an all-right coalition in the Reichstag after the election, so the party's central committee has requested a mass propaganda drive from the 2nd Chairman. An aggressive promotion campaign for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten and Der Tag, expansion of the Telegraphen-Union news agency and promotion of their articles to more and more newspapers, perhaps even a few movie deals - all could serve to form the desired image of the old Party of Tirpitz out there.\n\nWhere should the resources of the campaign be concentrated, however? Focusing on the Illustrierte Nachtausgabe and cutting deals with urban newspapers will improve the DVLP's chances to win the middle class in the cities and cut down social democratic growth - on the other hand, the Telegraphen-Union has fostered good relations with independent rural news outlets, and investing more in this relationship will aid the conservative cause in the Prussian countryside."

That state intervention may help drive up demand and reinvigorate the economy during the financial cycle has been contemplated during the interwar period and these ideas have only gained more traction since Black Monday.\n\nThe journal of the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), Die Arbeit, has opened discussion on what they have named \"active economic policy\" after the publication of a political economic programme by the trade unionists Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade. This plan, titled the "Tarnow-Baade Plan" after its creators, posits the creation of massive public works which could employ up to one million people across the Empire, as well as tighter banking controls which would allow an extensive inflationary policy. According to Tarnow and Baade, work creation and fiscal inflation will provide relief for the poor and drive up demand, solving the downfall.\n\nThough the ADGB is closely allied with the SPD, the party has actually distanced itself from the Tarnow-Baade Plan. Otto Wels and Rudolf Hilferding have both criticised the ADGB for its direct intervention in politics, which should be delegated solely to the party, and for Tarnow and Baade's intentions to "play doctor at the bedside of capitalism".

The relentless focus of the Hugenberg press on their owner's persona, with only cursory mentions of his role within the DVLP, raises concerns about his motives; it is hard to ignore the fact that he is building up his personal reputation.

Three decades of intense linguistic debate followed, often mired in the political question of whether the Baltic peoples belong to the Slavic world or are somewhere outside of it.\n\nNewly published works by two Baltic linguists - Latvian Jānis Endzelīns and Lithuanian Kazimieras Būga, both of whom currently teach Baltic linguistics in German universities - have set forward numerous arguments why the 'Balto-Slavic' hypothesis is untenable. This includes unexplainable phonetic and morphological differences and a complete lack of transitory dialects which are common in other linguistic groups such as Romance. Endzelīns's previous theory, which claims that similarities between Baltic and Slavic languages emerged because of long historical proximity, is now considered to be a more likely explanation. Būga is a bit more radical, having gone on record to claim that he hasn't found \"a single linguistic fact which would require us to accept a so-called Aesti-Slav proto-language\".\n\nWe hope that future textbooks across Europe will take these reevaluations of historical fact into account and integrate the Baltic languages as a separate and equal group within the greater Indo-Germanic family."

While some members of PAC view the Third Internationale's extension into China as a potential threat to the native revolution practised in China, the PAC nonetheless has shown a willingness to work with members of the orthodox faction of the Chinese Syndicalist Party as well as an equally beneficial relationship with the World Society. As one of the two major political cliques in the Kuomintang, the PAC seeks to enlighten the masses of China and transform the Chinese proletariat into a force of revolutionary change to entirely defeat the warlords, expel the imperialists, and fulfil the dream of Sun Yat-sen.

The RCA, led primarily by Chen Gongbo, but including the closest friends and followers of Wang Jingwei - believes that if the revolution is to be saved, it must be reorganised in the same spirit as 1924. The Kuomintang, in their eyes, must be purged of its excess democratic and reactionary forces; only then will China achieve her national revolution.\n\nOnce a secret faction amongst the Chinese expatriate community in Europe, with the return of the Central Committee, the RCA has emerged as one of the Kuomintang's two major political parties. They adhere to a model of strict leadership (seeing the Kuomintang as the vanguard of the socialist revolution) and a party for the peasantry, workers, and petite bourgeoisie. They hold warm and cordial ties with the Third Internationale, and many RCA members also hold relations with the radical wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party. Nonetheless, it is a movement that sees the Chinese Nationalist cause as not just one for China but also one for the entirety of Asia. The RCA runs on a platform that China is the socialist vanguard, spreading the revolution far and wide and liberating the oppressed peoples of Asia from the chains of imperialism. The RCA consists of two wings - the radical wing led by Chen Gongbo and a moderate wing led by Gu Mengyu - with their views differing over issues such as the nature of class struggle in China or land reform.\n\nVarious setbacks and unforeseen circumstances have seen the RCA lose its once dominant position in the Central Committee to formerly marginalised right wing elements within the party.

Despite losing power he managed to hold control over his clique until 1920, when his nephew Wang Wenhua staged a coup called the Minjiu incident, leading to the deaths of several prominent figures under Liu. Wang's brutality, however, meant he never took full power in Guizhou, and was assassinated by Yuan Zuming in 1921.\n\nThis secured Yuan's position as leader of the Old Guizhou Clique.

 IRE_totalist_party_long:9 "Saor Éire\n§gSaor Éire, meaning \"Free Ireland\", was formed by Peadar O'Donnell after his ejection from Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin following the British Revolution, when the left wing of the party was purged due to the anti-socialist fervour in Ireland at the time.\n\nAs far as Saor Éire are concerned, the Irish Revolution of the early 1920s was one of the worst missed opportunities in Irish history, even by their own standards. They believe had only the masses just been a little more educated, a little more informed, just a little bit more class conscious, a Worker's Republic could have been achieved, instead of the \"bourgeois\" one that took its place. For Saor Éire, imperialism and capitalism are two sides of the same exploitative force, one which must be violently purged from Ireland. Related to this, is an intense distrust of the clergy from within the party, particularly their conservatism and \"trappings of wealth and excess\".\n\nThe ranks of Saor Éire are filled with bitter veterans of the War of Independence, who make up the resurrected underground paramilitary wing of the party, the Irish Citizen Army. However, their progress has been stunted for years by two major stumbling blocks: Firstly, the rather robust nature of the reactionary Irish state, which has done what it can to dissolve the party, and secondly, the constant internal bickering over how involved the Union of Britain should be in their struggle. Saor Éire attempt to appeal to the poorest in Irish society, particularly farmers and farm workers, and their vision for the future is as agrarian as it is militant and radical.§!\n"
 IRE_syndicalist_party_text:9 "§gThe Irish Syndicalist Party was founded during the War of Independence by Roddy Connolly, son of the martyred James Connolly, following his return from the Commune of France after being there seeking international support for Ireland's revolution. This iteration was quickly put down by the British government, and the party was later revived by Jim Larkin Jnr. in the late 1920s, as a spiritual successor to his father's banned party, the Irish Worker's League. The ISP espouses the beliefs of orthodox syndicalism and republicanism, and sees itself as continuing the legacy of James Connolly's efforts in 1916, and the several small Soviets that formed during the War of Independence.\n\nOne of the major challenges in the implementation of syndicalism in Ireland is the lack of a major industrial base, and in an effort to combat this, the ISP has been in discussion the France and Britain, in seeking international support for building up Ireland's industry, should the party's revolutionary efforts come to fruition. While officially banned, the party is led by Jim Larkin Snr., and is largely made up of the more radical former Labour Party and trade union members who have been expelled from their respective organisations due their more ardent socialist leanings. Being very much an internationalist party, the ISP's goals can be summarised by James Connolly himself; \"For our demands most moderate are, we only want the earth.\"§!\n"

Made up of much of the former student wing of Labour, as well as some more senior dissidents within the party, the PLP take a dim view on any form of repression of civil liberties. Unsurprisingly, this puts them at odds with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, but their non-confrontational parliamentary demeanour has meant that their existence is tolerated, for now.\n\nTheir policies on social justice include supporting the abolition of the death penalty, removal of all political censorship, protections of freedom of speech, and pro-feminism views. Campaigning for a more encompassing welfare state than the mainstream Labour Party, with whom they share the belief of workers' rights, they also promote large scale formation of cooperative businesses and encourage farm collectivisation.

Such as this, the party would be more Anglophilic than others, while still advocating complete independence, and would class itself as being very pro-business and fiscally conservative. The party see Mitteleuropa as an excellent opportunity to benefit from foreign investment, and hold an ambivalent view on religion and the Church.

The party traces its origins to a split-off from Sinn Féin after the 1922 election, when Cathal Brugha would leave the party over disagreements regarding social policy and Collins' role in government, creating \"Cumann an tSaorstáit\", or \"Society of the Republic\". After an underwhelming term in office following a surprise win in the 1926 election, the party has regrouped with former Príomh Aire de Valera taking up leadership, along with changing the party's name and pushing it to his specific vision.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil draw quite a number of their views directly from Catholic doctrine, and would favour more development of Ireland's existing agrarianism over further industrialisation. The party would find themselves firmly more conservative than Sinn Féin on social matters, but is to Sinn Féin's left economically, as they are more willing to consider certain \"social justice\"-based policies advocated by the Church.

 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text:9 "Sinn Féin\n§gSinn Féin, meaning \"Ourselves\", have undoubtedly been the pre-eminent party in Ireland since the mid-1910s. The oldest party in the state, they were founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, originally promoting a Dual Monarchy between Great Britain and Ireland akin to Austria-Hungary, proposing that Irish MPs abstain from Westminster and instead meet in Dublin. Although they remained abstentionist, this policy radically shifted to republicanism following the party being erroneously credited with the Easter Rising of 1916. Griffith remained working with the party, handed over party leadership to surviving 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, and the party steamrolled into power in the 1918 Home Rule Election, foregoing any British authority and instead forming Dáil Éireann in Dublin.\n\nAfter the small split in the party following the War of Independence and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, it has been the current party's vision that has moulded the young republic. Seen as the party of the Irish middle class, they have formed the pillars of Law, Order, Religious Pluralism and International Trade.

He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

With multiple TDs elected from each constituency, a strong party-focused democratic tradition has developed in Ireland, favouring the existence of multiple parties, and ensuring that coalitions and other agreements are often a necessity in the successful formation of a government.\n\nConsidering the banning of the syndicalist parties from elections, the disinterest of the UDP to participate outside of their north-eastern heartlands, and the abstentionism of some members of Aontas Náisiúnta, there are seven different parties competing for a position in government.\n\nConfounding this multi-party system however, is the office of Uachtarán, or President. The Presidency is directly chosen by the people, using a single-transferable-vote, at the same time as the Dáil election. This means that whoever wins the plurality of votes on the initial count, may not end up in charge after all the rounds of counting are completed. While voting for an \"outside candidate\" can never be a wasted vote, unlike some other democracies, the end result is still that the candidates that hold the broadest appeal across the political spectrum are likely to be successful.\n\nAs Ireland is a Presidential Republic, the first role of the President is to attempt to form a government, almost guaranteed to include their own party. Even with multiple parties running for the office, only a few are seen as having a genuine chance of gaining the Presidency itself.\n\nThe parties that have a chance at the Presidency, and to lead the formation of a government, are §gSinn Féin§!, §cAn Saorstát Críostúil§! and the §SLabour Party§!.\n\nThe current likely winner is [IRE_loc_election_plurality_holder]"

 ireland.33.d1:9 "As SC suspected beforehand, the Anglophile leanings of many of the National Development Party's notables have resulted in problems arising as they engaged in talks to form a government. The NDP's leader Seán Lemass, although nowhere near as pro-British as his fellows, is a sternly pragmatic man who unlike SC, spares little sympathy for the plight of Northern Catholics, and regards the resuscitation of the Irish economy as the utmost priority, fearing that alienating loyalists while the effects of Black Monday still continue to take their detrimental toll on the island, might derail any efforts by sparking instability.\n\nHe has insisted that An Saorstát Críostúil must agree to avoid the issue of the Ulster Privileges as a condition for the formation of any coalition between SC and the NDP. Éamon de Valera and his party, on the other hand, are keenly aware that should such the news of such an agreement be leaked in the currently heated political environment, the consequences could be disastrous. As a cunning negotiator and possessing a good personal and working relationship with Lemass, de Valera could try to haggle with Lemass on this matter, pledging to bring Ireland's financial situation under control first, and resolve the issue of the Privileges afterwards, though some of Lemass's colleagues will be less than pleased."
 ireland.34.d2:9 "With the National Development Party refusing to budge on the Ulster Privileges, Éamon de Valera became reluctantly convinced of the necessity to form a coalition with Aontas Náisiúnta. Eoin O'Duffy, keen to legitimise his party in the mainstream and regain his position as a major figure in the running of the country, eagerly opened negotiations, though neither men particularly trusted the other. In exchange for AN's support, de Valera agreed that a commission on corporatist economic policies would be established and an uncompromising line on Ulster taken, aiming for the ultimate abolition of the privileges.\n\nAlthough both believed membership of Mitteleuropa to have negative ramifications for Irish sovereignty, the two leaders concluded that a slow and steady approach was necessary to loosen ties with the bloc without worsening the financial crisis.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. Hardline nationalists and anti-syndicalists are delighted by the result, hoping that SC and AN will restore order and stability to the nation, as are the Church and faithful voters at seeing a government based on Christian principles, after years of Sinn Féin's quasi-secularism. In Ulster, a visible sense of hope is felt on the streets and in the homes of Catholic areas, concerns about Brugha's previous failure to change the Ulster Privileges dampened by the expectation that AN should ensure \"Dev\" keeps his word. The mood among Protestants is quite the contrary, their seething discontent with Dublin only intensening, to the deep concern of local Gardaí who have already begun to pick up rumours in the wind of radical loyalists beginning to stockpile weapons."

After discussions between the two, it was agreed that Hassell would issue a strongly-worded condemnation of the incident and assure that the "German sword and shield" would stand behind the Irish against syndicalist aggression, so as to deter the British from further transgressions, but that for now the German response would remain diplomatic."

Harry Midgley's NILP, though officially non-sectarian, have become a party primarily of the Protestant working class, and there exist whispers of support for the union of Northern Ireland with the Union of Britain, with rhetoric playing on resentment that the upper class in 1926 \"chose money over Ulster\". The UPL, led by former UUP politician James Hanna McCormick, is stridently anti-Catholic and also regard the UDP as traitors, calling for a policy of abstentionism toward Dáil Éireann.

 ireland.3240.d:9 "For as long as the Gaels have existed, so has migration. The very forefathers of the Gaelic race originated from Iberia, and Hibernian monks carried out their holy endeavours across Europe at the height of Irish civilisation. After the English conquest, many nobles and commoners alike sought refuge on the continent during the 16th and 17th centuries. But it was the so-called famine of the 1840s that did the most damage, halving the Irish population through a combination of mass death and exile, and creating a culture of emigration that would see the island's demographics unremittingly decrease for nearly a century afterwards.\n\nIt would take the improvement of Ireland's economic situation following the nation's entry into Mitteleuropa, and the fall of America and Britain into chaos and revolution respectively to bring this lengthy decline to an end, though some would continue to emigrate to the likes of Canada and Germany. The flow of people leaving the isle would lessen further during Black Monday, due to the global nature of the crisis. However, as a result of dissatisfaction with the integralist government and recovering financial circumstances elsewhere, Ireland now faces another wave of emigrants.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin has denounced such exiles as "péistí", meaning "worms" in English, accusing them of deserting their native land and harbouring syndicalist sympathies. Acting to stem the tide of migrants, the coast guard has been placed on patrol to halt any illegal rafts fleeing the island, and a series of harsh decrees proclaimed requiring Irish citizens to seek approval from the state before departing from the country or returning from abroad. Said permission is only to be granted under stringent conditions, and a severe sentence is to be imposed for unauthorised travel. Through these decisive measures, the authorities hope to prevent a brain drain and ensure that Irish demographics will soon rise back to their pre-famine heights."
 ireland.3900.d1:9 "With Ireland now a part of the Internationale - and a partner to Britain - an unusual political issue has emerged: Oliver Cromwell. Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."

 irelandflavour.3810.d.start:9 "For the anniversary of the retirement of late historian and Senator Alice Stopford Green, a work has been published which examines an area of her interest — Irish nationalism among Protestants and the Anglo-Irish. Given her own background, this subject matter came of no surprise.\n\nThe book argues the irrefutability that since 1798, the Anglo-Irish have played a crucial role in the development of Irish nationalism and republicanism. Anglo-Irish and Protestants never made up more than 15% of the population, and while they would have been overwhelmingly loyalist historically, those who took up the nationalist cause made a disproportionate impact in nationalism as a whole.\n\nFrom the founders of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the movement's leadership has included Protestants, helped by the greater status and education that was afforded to them for centuries. Robert Emmet led his rebellion in 1803, and Charles Stewart Parnell was de facto leader of nationalism in the 1880s. Outside politics, literary greats Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats are also known for their nationalist ideals. The involvement of Protestants in nationalism, it argues, was key in separating the Catholic identity from the Irish one in the late 1700s, a time when they were entwined.\n\nThe book goes as far as contemporary Ireland, focusing on the fringes of politics, such as socialist academic Benjamin Farrington, or integralism proponent Ernest Blythe, and commenting on how the British Revolution may have influenced the popularity of different political groups among this population."
 irelandflavour.3810.d1:9 "$irelandflavour.3810.d.start$\n\nFor reasonably dry, academic text, the response has been fairly warm, with critics opining that the state's treatment of minorities should be used as a marker of its maturity.

 irelandflavour.3812.d3:9 "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, especially in recent years as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Even those in government need a break from it all every now and then, especially with their ongoing arduous task of reshaping the political landscape of the country. The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\". Following such high praise and positive reviews, it can only be hoped that this is just the beginning of a new exciting era of Irish theatre."

The creation of the new Provincial Council was announced earlier today by the President of the GAA, making it very clear that the GAA's plans to foster the rebirth of Irish culture in Britain are only just beginning.\n\nAlthough at present only the London and Lancashire county boards make up the newly established British GAA, there is already discussion on how to properly incorporate the more minor county boards of Warwickshire, Yorkshire, and Gloucestershire into the GAA while also establishing proper county boundaries across Britain. Steps have already been taken in Ireland to help foster the growth of the Games in Britain, with this year's annual congress finally abolishing the archaic Rule 21 which banned all members of British security forces from joining the GAA.\n\nWhile Ireland will almost certainly remain the home and core of the Games, many are hopefully within a few decades the British scene will have fully established itself as a key part of the GAA with tefams from both countries competing against each other."

 JBS_country_intro_content:9 "Founded on the ruins of the Second Saudi State, the great emirs of Ha'il built the foundations of the Rashidi state. That this state was to last only a few decades, until the ascent of Ibn Saud in 1904, was not foreseen but was nevertheless inevitable as the brutal reign of the Shammari over the folk of Najd distanced the proud Rashidis from the main brunt of the Arabian population and economy. Through a series of battles, the Rashidi armies were pushed back first from Riyadh and later from all parts of the Arab interior until all they had left was their homeland in the region of Jabal Shammar.\n\nDifferently from the other Arab warlords however, the emirs of Ha'il maintained close relations with the Sublime Porte whom readily used them as the shield to defend their Southern flank. This relationship would continue into the Weltkrieg as whilst the Hashemites sided with Britain and the Saudis sided with themselves, the Emirs of Jabal Shammar put all their money on the Ottoman Empire, remaining loyal even during the Porte's darkest days. Whilst this loyalty was greatly rewarded after the war, it put a large target on the Rashidis who became seen as Ottoman lapdogs and traitors to the Arab cause.\n\nDespite 'victory' in the Weltkrieg, the Emirate has not seen the fortune it hoped to acquire by siding with the Turks and although relations with Kostantiniyye remain warm, the industrial revolution and its spread to the Middle East have greatly harmed the already fragile Shammari economy. Reliant on pilgrims travelling through the Arab interior towards Mecca for their Hajj, the advent of steam ships, cars and most importantly the Ottoman rail network have struck massive blows to this ancient trade.\n\nBacked in by a prospering but apathetic Ottoman state and an expansionist Saudi state, the Emirs of Ha'il will have to reinvent themselves, seek new sources of revenue and maintain the loyalty of their remaining supporters or be definitively erased from the history books.\n\n§CDecisions to prepare for the war with Najd and Hasa are available.§!"

 jbs.20.d:9 "Ever since the coup which installed Muhammad ibn Talal, the real power within Ha'il lay with the al-Subhan family whom through their connections and influence in the Majlis controlled every aspect of life within Jabal Shammar. Nevertheless it seems that the taste of power has now gone to their head as Saud al-Subhan, former regent of our young Emir, has taken the opportunity to crown himself Emir of Ha'il and finally rid himself of the coalition with the Rashidis his family has entertained for over five decades.\n\nWhether this move will prove wise is yet to be seen however as the continued weakness of the government in Ha'il has not gone unnoticed amongst the tribes of Najd. Furthermore, Kostantiniyye has refused to acknowledge the al-Subhan scion as the new Emir, reserving the title for a Prince of the House of Rashid. Backed against a Turkish anvil to the North and a Najdi hammer to the South, the future will tell if the city of Ha'il can save itself from collapse."

After Sun Chuanfang marched into Zhejiang, Li was hired by Sun and was sent to Japan in 1923-1924. After his return, he spent most time concluding and publishing his observations on the most dangerous enemy of China and aiding Sun Chuanfang in training new officers. Although Li disagrees with the concessionist nature of the League, he stays for the considerable publishing resources in Zhejiang and ideal environment for military academic dicussion and exchange with the powers, particularly with Germany, which Li regards as the most militarily advanced power.\n\n§YNotes: As a prolific military intellectual, Li Erkang, editor of several military journals in Zhejiang, has published and translated countless military works, some of the most noticeable works are \"New Military Tactics Learnt in the European War\" (1916),\"Toxic Gas and Toxic Smoke\" (1928), \"National Defence and Supplies\" (1929), \"Japan's Military Understanding after the European War\" (1929) and \"Youth Military Training Course\" (1931). Some believe that part of the the military thought of Jiang Baili is inspired by Li, as Jiang highly praised Li's ideas in the preface of Li's \"National Defence and Supplies\", where Li calls for comprehensive national, economic and social mobilisation against inevitable Japanese aggression. As the mentor of Chen Cheng and sworn brother of Chen Lifu, Li Erkang is also well-connected in the rightist element of the KMT, and he tried to persuade Sun to cooperate with the KMT in the Northern Expedition.§!"

However, they all bow to the authority of the League Marshal as overall Commander of the joint forces. Numerous and in large quantity, the League Army still proved radically in-effective in light of the smaller National Revolutionary Army. Solders born from Whampoa were able to consistently trounce our much bigger forces, only being driven back by the German intervention.\n\nWith the extensive modernisation program conducted by the renewed German Advisory Mission, and the enacting of a period of serious reform, analysis, and reconstruction of the League Army of old, the new glorious United Army of the Five Provinces truly represents the peak of modernity and warrior spirit within the Chinese nation.

This, combined with weakening communications with Wang's government in exile, has created a certain independence within MinGan cadres, even as the movement has reunited again.\n\nWhilst its influence within the broader League itself is frayed at best, the Kuomintang continues as a spectral remnant of the past.

Soon after their formation, in 1929, they joined the Chinese Empire Reform Association coalition in Beijing in order to try and create a united opposition bloc against the Harmony Association, due to a distaste of the Zhili's seeming apathy towards the concessions.\n\nWith limited influence within the League itself due to their opposition towards continued conduct with the Germans and blatant corruption, the NSF is but a minor interest group of intellectuals. More powerful within Beijing than that of Nanjing. However Sun Chuanfang personally finds them rather admirable, for their crusade against corruption and their willingness to abide by authoritarian government.

However following the appointment of Zhu Rui as Governor, Zhejiang would enter a concrete period of military politics. Increasingly conservative and split upon military and civilian facets, Qu Yingguang and Zhu Rui would support the Hongxian Emperor, and as a result would see the erasure of the movement from the provincial assembly.\n\nFlourishing once more in the 1920s, Zhejiang would see its own Constitution drafted along the example set by Hunan.

Considering his options, and with the hopes of furthering his arms race with Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang signed to a stringent and pervasive series of economic deals with the bank, in exchange for further loans and extensive German military hardware.\n\nFollowing the 80-Division plan which saw implementation within the Central Government and the League, the Shanghai Uprising would throw a wrench into the amicable relationship between Smiling Tiger and GEAS. Coinciding with the latter's corruption scandal and its position being made aware to other powers within China, they would form the A.O.G as an attempt to further enwrap themselves within China.

Of course, the Marshal already knows who the culprit is, and whilst he did not collaborate with the other players that brought down the Smiling Tiger, he nonetheless quite magnificently manouvered his way through the quagmire and mania. Finally achieving his penultimate position, any information within the investigative report that could lead to Qi would undoubtedly not leave this palace.\n\nSitting rather patiently within his office, a subtle knock would manifest upon his door, as Tian adjorned by the investigation team waltzed into the Marshal's lair. Sitting within the singular chair situated opposite of the Marshal, Tian would stand next to his master as the investigator produced a sealed folder from his briefcase. Presenting it to the League Marshal, Qi callously tore open the folder, as the investigator began to disclose his team's findings.\n\nIt would appear that their investigation concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by none other than one of Sun Chuanfang's many associates!

Discussion occured for hours, with Du playing particularly coy to Qi's advances for the majority. At the end however, a plan was devised and agreed upon. Unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\", it stipulates that Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, allowing Qi to maintain a stable currency balance. To pay for this, Nanjing will keep Du on a direct payroll, with the agreement that 40% of his wages will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities.\n\nWith Qi's gloved hand shaking Du's firm one, the two men and their respective parties nodded, parting ways into the dark of night.

It is a party that unites Lithuanian Polish interests and campaigns for issues that matter to them first and foremost, such as cultural and political autonomy, funding of Polish language education in Białystok and Vilnius regions, and deeper economic, cultural and political ties with Poland. Aside from these core issues, the party is largely non-ideological, the political positions of their members varying from aristocratic conservatism to near-Syndicalism.§!\n"
 LIT_market_liberal_party_long:9 "Demokratinė tautos laisvės santara\n§gThe Democratic National Freedom League, more commonly known as just Santara, is a minor liberal political party in Lithuania which was first founded by many famous Lithuanian politicians in exile in 1917. Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population. It is an outlet for liberal ideas in Lithuania - Santara champions secularism, religious tolerance, liberalism, and sees itself as a mediator between the left and the right.§!\n"
 LIT_social_conservative_party_long:9 "Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partija\n§gThe Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian right-wing, originally founded in 1917, although its predecessor movements are claimed to have started operating as early as 1890. A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents. Regardless of the wing, however, ideas such as Christian ethics, monarchism, and democracy unite them all.§!\n"
 LIT_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:9 "Lietuvių tautininkų sąjunga\n§gThe Lithuanian Nationalist Union is the successor to the National Progress Party, founded in 1929, and holds the right-wing nationalist niche which the Christian Democrats have pretty much abandoned. The Nationalist Union unites around the larger-than-life persona of Antanas Smetona, once the head of the Council of Lithuania and the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, turned the leader of the Lithuanian nationalist cause. The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, and freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need for a strong executive, in corporatist and state-controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever-present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'. Despite its professed allegiance to the King and Democracy, it comes into direct conflict with the Lithuanian left wing, which sees them as a direct road towards authoritarianism.§!\n"

It unites the radical, militant and reactionary forces of the Lithuanian political spectrum, those who cannot find a home in any legal political parties. Knowledge about how the movement operates is very scarce, but it is believed that they have no universally recognised leader and are split among several influential political visions - despite that, however, a unifying feeling of hatred towards Germany, the government in Vilnius, and non-Lithuanians keeps them from dissolving. They spread their ideology through magazines such as Vairas, Naujoji Romuva and Tautos Kelias, as well as organise protests, raids and occasional terrorist activity.

For a long time, they have formed the main part of the LAF's armed operations. The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus: 'The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence. Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy.'§!\n"

Their Second National Revival will look back into Lithuania's pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'.

Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.§!\n"

The offer is promptly denied by Żeligowski and Lithuanian troops preparing to storm the city when the LAF seizing the chance to attack both forces approach the town. Żeligowski sends a quick message of truce to Zyndram-Kościałkowski, who is more than happy to work together to defeat the LAF. The Lithuanian Army and the Polish rebels succeed in driving out the LAF, who cannot deal with both sides' combined firepower and numbers. Thankful for their assistance, Żeligowski allows the forces of Zyndram-Kościałkowski to leave the city but not before the two men share a respectful Polish salute with one another. In turn, the people of Białystok are grateful for the peaceful conclusion of the conflict and soon begin to call Żeligowski the "Knight of Białystok" - seeing him as a hero that saved the city from ruin."
 LIT.335.d:9 "Peace and order have finally returned to the streets of Białystok. The citizens emerge from their hiding places, and cellars — the street barricades constructed by Zyndram-Kościałkowski have been torn down. Despite the shared bloodshed against the LAF, Zyndram-Kościałkowski has still been branded as a rebel in Vilnius and remains on the run. As for Żeligowski, it appears that he is indeed fully committed to Narutowicz's version of a new Lithuania, one of shared ethnic unity. Some of the citizens of Białystok have even declared that they identify as "Litewski-Polski" - Polish by ethnicity, but Lithuanian by nationality. Jews, Poles, and Lithuanians are all unified together to stand against the hateful ideas of the LAF. This is something that Narutowicz is truly hopeful for, and the cessation of tensions in Białystok seems to reinforce the idea that perhaps ethnic unity could be possible."
 LIT.336.d:9 "Narutowicz with his guard meet Plechavičius at the very building where Narutowicz and 19 other members of the Council of Lithuania signed the "Act of Independence of Lithuania". The building itself once a Russian drama theatre, is now abandoned, with its German owners long having left the city, along with their hopes of turning the building into a place of German culture.\n\nPlechavičius instructs the guard to remain as he and Narutowicz enter the building, with Plechavičius removing his holstered side arm and throwing it at the feet of Narutowicz's nearest guardsmen. Narutowicz raised his hand before any further protest could be made and followed Plechavičius into the building, to eventually be led to the very room where the act was signed.\n\nTo his bemusement and relief, sitting in the room is Antanas Smetona, who invited him to sit in the chair next to him. Smetona is quick to the point, he stated he openly detested Narutowicz's perversion of his new "Lithuanian" culture and states he will never support such a notion. He went on to state though this may be his views, he also cannot tolerate the LAF and their "unholy" views they hold and in short, sees them as the greater devil. Smetona proposed that with his contacts in the LAF, he can persuade several important members and their men to leave the LAF with the condition of amnesty given.\n\nNarutowicz firstly scoffed at this notion, stating Smetona has no real power here, and furthermore, what guarantees could he offer Narutowicz that he like the LAF, won't attempt to lead a coup against his government? Smetona grinned and as if by command, several members of the LAF forces entered the room, with Plechavičius drawing his concealed sabre, staring right at Smetona with a look of betrayal on his face. Smetona raised his hand at Plechavičius and stated, “These men have wished to surrender themselves to you Narutowicz, though of course I promised them amnesty and I hope you will allow me to hold my word to these men and others that will follow". Upon hearing this, Plechavičius broke out into a laugh, sheathing his sabre and slapped Narutowicz on the back, stating Smetona, the old fox still has it. Smetona stated his only request for assisting Narutowicz is that he be allowed to reform the LTS and be allowed back into the Seimas. Narutowicz thought about this deal long and hard, but internalising that Smetona had said earlier regarding “the lesser devil”. Narutowicz agreed to Smetona's terms and struck a deal with him."
 LIT.343.d:9 "Stanisław Narutowicz has long been an influential figure in Lithuanian politics; indeed, many consider him one of the founding fathers of the modern Lithuanian state. A self-declared Samogitian, Lithuanian, and Pole, Narutowicz aims for an ethnically unified Lithuanian nation where Poles would be able to champion their own language and culture, all the while identifying as "Lithuanian." Given his influence in Lithuanian politics as well as his Polish identity, Narutowicz has long served as head of the KPL/LLK since the early 1920s. However, with the rise of ethnic tensions surfacing in Lithuania once again, the right wing of the KPL and the LLK has seen a rise in popularity. Led by Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski, the right wing of the KPL/LLK has grown more aggressive in recent days - receiving support from the Polish minority in Białystok and nationalists in [POL.getname]. A constant thorn in the side of Narutowicz's ambition, Narutowicz wishes to find out the true extent of the right wing's goals. With his approval, an operation is set up to infiltrate the right wing and seek out their true intentions."
 LIT.346.d:9 "Plechavičius forces begin to obtain the upper hand over Zyndram-Kościałkowski, and his men. Though outraged by Plechavičius thinking he can play "warlord" in Lithuania, Narutowicz's has sent Żeligowski to relief Plechavičius of his command, and to face censure in Vilnius. There is a brief stand-off between the two ex-Imperial Russian generals, with Plechavičius and his cohort leaving unceremoniously, last seen heading towards Šiauliai."

Following the Xinhai Revolution, the Beiyang Government made its best assurances towards the loyal Inner Mongolian Princes and Nobles (of which were the majority) that their rights, titles, and positions would remain the same. Further establishing three special districts in the western part of Inner Mongolia in 1914, being that of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, the Inner Mongolian Nobles enjoyed a sense of privilege within the Beiyang Government. Resisting the Bogd Khanate's attempts to incorporate Inner Mongolia in 1915, the Nobles of the region would see service in the Beiyang Government as senators, and otherwise played the disparate Northern Warlords against eachother.\n\nClosely following events within Outer Mongolia, the conflict there would soon reach the Inner Mongolian citizens, as Roman Ungern-Sternberg advanced into Chahar, fighting first the Guominjun, and then the Fengtian Clique. In the destabilising situation, and with Ungern's brutal reprisals against Chinese surmounting, the various Inner Mongolian princes formed two bodies: the Noyodyn Zövlöl and the Mongolyn Avtonomit Kholboo. Aiming to preserve their special privileges and the safety of their citizens, the Mongolian Autonomous Federation is a uniquely Inner Mongolian outgrowth in national politics, led by the Kuomintang connected Wu Heling.§!\n"

However, ever since Ungern came to power in 1920, the wealth and influence of the aristocrats has been under threat. Ungern has proven in recent years that he does not fear seizing the wealth of these nobles, nor does he fear cracking down on their influence to keep control. Whilst ostensibly keen to feud with eachother and the Lamas over influence of the Outer Mongolian State, the various Nobles alongside their respective Leagues and Banners managed to dash their differences in light of a greater foe.\n\nIn 1927, the princes and aristocrats of Mongolia joined together in an organisation titled the Noyodyn Zövlöl. Bringing together the four major leagues of the Northern Desert; the Khan'alin League, the Qiqirlik League, the Chechen League, and the Zakbilaseqin Bidurnuoer League, it also brought together the Khovd Tribes, and the newly incorporated Inner Mongolian Leagues; Jirim, Josotu and Xilingol.

The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu has stated that the main point of the group is to make sure that when the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu (the spiritual leader of Mongolian Buddhism, the top ranking lama in Mongolia and the reincarnation of the Bogd Khan) is of age, Ungern will give up his role as regent and allow the true leader of Mongolia to take the reins.\n\nUnder the surface however, the Buddhist Council also serves as the most concentrated exertion of the influence of the Lamas within Mongolia. Having long feuded with the Nobles and Princes, and fearful of both the MAN and of Ungern, they nonetheless remain steadfast in their influence on the young 7th Changkya Khutukhtu.

 MON_paternal_autocrat_party_sternberg_long:9 "Russian Military Clique (Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika)\n§gCentred around the enigmatic, polite, eccentric, and brutal dictator of Mongolia, Roman Ungern-Sternberg, the stupendously dubbed \"Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika\", or Russian Military Clique, by native Mongolians is the direct circle of the \"Mad\" Baron. Having successfully gained control of Mongolia in 1920, after moving into Urga with his Asiatic Cavalry Division and brutally forcing out the Chinese with the blessing of the Bogd Khan, the Russian Military Clique became, insofar as observers are concerned, the dominant military force within Mongolia. Aiding in Ungern's callous and cruel eradication of Mongolia's Jewish population alongside the Chinese and putting down both of the Mongolian People's Party's revolts, the RVK has gained much ire amongst the Mongolian populace.\n\nEven as far as Russia is concerned, the RVK are but a useful pawn to ensure a compliant Mongolia, even it is unlikely Ungern is to ever return. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Ungern became permanent regent of Mongolia, waiting for the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu to be found. Having been found in Tibet in 1933, Ungern moved the boy to Mongolia, having him installed as Khan. Ungern continues to dominate as regent, as was stipulated by the Bogd Khan himsefl. He has utilised his tenure in Mongolia to strengthen the Khanate, its traditional values, and excise all enemies of the Khan from Mongolia. Egalitarian yet cruel, and harkening towards a bygone era, the Russian Military Clique is by far an extension of one man's lone romanticism in the modern age.§!\n"

Following the death of the §PBogd Khan§! in 1924, the §RMAN§! rebelled again, claiming §PUngern§! no longer held any legitimacy in the country. This revolution was harshly repressed, and the §RMAN§! were forced into hiding once more. In this time, §PUngern§! made deals with the §nRussian§! government, for economic and military support. §PUngern§! was also able to seize Xilingol from the §lChinese§! §gGuominjun§!. §PUngern's§! rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by §nBuddhist lamas§!, §PUngern§! purged many high ranking §nlamas§! in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the death of the §PBogd Khan§!, the hunt began for the 9th reincarnation of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was eventually found in 1933 in Lhasa, Tibet.

 MOR_country_intro_content:9 "In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire, and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered massive riots. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Zaian Confederation of Berbers rebelled against France and received ample Central Power support, but failed to achieve any major victories until after the fall of France. While various pretenders attempted to negotiate with the German Empire, they were inconclusive, and in the end, Mohammed V was placed on the throne after his father abdicated. The new Sultan signed a new treaty with the Germans, one whose influence on internal Moroccan affairs was greatly diminished compared to the French Protectorate. The treaty is carefully worded as to render it as amicable as possible. However, tensions still flare up on occasion, sometimes requiring the German-backed Royal Guard to intervene.\n\nAs the '30s roared in, Morocco recovered from the Protectorate era, yet relations with Algiers remain quite cool, event to the point that some nationalists advocate strengthening the alliance with the German Empire to secure Moroccan independence. The Sultan must safeguard Morocco against not only the revanchist French elites in Algeria, but also the savage revolutionaries in Paris who see Morocco as a gateway for the revolution into Africa and the Islamic World."

 PER_Khasab_Invasion_desc:9 "An enclave of the Muscati state, the peninsula of Khasab is one of the most crucial positions in the Middle East. Singlehandedly having the capacity to completely cut off the strait of Hormuz, thus cutting Iran and Iraq off from the world's economy, it has been a thorn in the sight of both Kostantiniyye and Teheran. With Muscat however forming a neutral power between the two rivalling blocs, an acceptable compromise seem to have been reached and for centuries the Sultans of the Muscati thalassocracy have been able to govern the peninsula uncontested.\n\nThe decay of the Muscati state has however not gone unnoticed and with tensions rising between the two largest powers in the region, the peninsula has found itself a pawn in a dangerous game. The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours. This goodwill seems to have run out as naval manoeuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a similar response from the Caliphate, bringing the two to the brink of war."

Furthermore they claim that the establishment of the Fao fortress at the entrance of the Shatt al-Arab is in open breach with the protocols, thus nullifying them and reaffirming the Iranian claim on a larger slice of the estuary."

In a quick firefight, the nationalist militia fled the town after several of their members were taken out before they could even register what was going on.\n\nAs inhabitants of the town reported after the fact, the veterans introduced themselves as "the Opera House", a small band with no purpose left but to defend their homeland against all threats.

So far, excessive violence against the Roma appears to have been prevented, but whether the Kwieks' aspirations to a "Presidency" of their own will be honoured remains to be seen.

The Governors themselves have sent numerous telegrams to the Cabinet and President requesting additional assistance to alleviate their overwhelmed governments. Following a province-wide declaration of martial law made in Hubei, Governor Xiao Yaonan has ordered his troops to shut down all bridges and roads leading into the province from the League's former territory, denying all entry to all refugees, A large number of them, dessicated, homeless and angry, began to mass at a bridge over the Yangtze River on the outskirts of Wuhan.\n\nInsisting on entry into the province, it initially began as a peaceful protest, rallying for proper responsible government action. However it quickly escalated into a borderline full-scale riot, as refugees began to react violently against Xiao's troops, chucking rocks at the border guards. Eventually a group of men who had somehow armed themselves with stolen weapons — perhaps due to the carelessness of Xiao's troops — began to shoot at the border guards, who responded by opening fire, first warning shots, and then at the opposing gunmen. Those not actively participating in the fighting fled, stampeding other refugees and leaving their friends or family for dead on the bridge. Such grisly events have been repeated up and down our border with the League, Sichuan and Shandong, as mobs of refugees fleeing civil war and suffering find their way into even more bloodshed."

The region's dominant party for decades has been the Romanian National Party (PNR), which fought hard against Magyarisation and has been instrumental in the final unification of all Romanian lands. While their hold of Transylvanian politics is near-absolute, they have been detached from pre-unification Romanian politics and have no presence in the rest of the country. To rectify this, they have approached the Peasants' Party (PT) of Ion Mihalache not only to form a coalition against the Legionaries and National Liberals, but to unify the two parties altogether.\n\nAfter long negotiations, the PNR and the PT have agreed to merge into a single party, the National Peasants Party (PNT), creating a formidable political bloc that could prevent the return of either the Legion or the National Liberals. The leadership of the PNT are now deciding on who will lead the unified party.\n\nVirgil Madgearu has been the Peasants' Party's main ideologue for most of its existence and has been an outspoken critic of both National Liberal and Legionary political monopolies. Representing the left-wing, his platform is centred around the \"Community of Producers\", supporting cooperative farming and the dominance of labour over capital.\n\nIuliu Maniu was one of the leaders of the PNR and is seen as leading the centre of the new party with a platform focusing on class collaboration and corporatism.\n\nAlexandru Vaida-Voevod was the other big name of the PNR and maintains a more conservative approach with the party's right-wing. His platform is economically-driven, focusing on regional development and national stability.\n\nThe three leaders, at their core, support a more decentralised approach compared to the centralism of the National Liberals and the Legion, mixed economic policies, and parliamentary democracy."

 romania.186.d:9 "Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino, rising star of the Legionary Movement and de facto intellectual leader of its more radical caucuses, has further cemented his status as a leading Legionary intellectual via the release of his new book, "Intre lumea legionara si lumea sindicalista" (Between The Legionary World and the Syndicalist World). Building upon his speeches of past student congresses like Romanul de maine (The Romanian of Tomorrow), he also compares the varying ideological systems of Totalism, Kemalism, Savinkovism, the Volkish movement and Balbian National Populism, as well as discussing Dostoyevsky, Berdyaev, Barrès and Jaurès. While he does acknowledge some similarities between the goals of Syndicalism and the Legionary Movement (namely, rejecting the nineteenth century's liberal tradition, abolishing social injustice, bank feudalism, privileges and capital speculations), he also sharply differentiates the movement from the Syndicalists in that they are considered worshippers of Marx, Proudhon and Pouget, builders of a second Tower of Babel who try to replace Christianity with atheism. Cantacuzino also considers that the Syndicalists are inhumane, annihilating the individual's personality and considering him as a means to an end, while Legionarism instead cares for their fellow peers and their physical and spiritual health, while also nurturing them and preparing the nation to "stand at the borders of Romanianism, ready to defend and elevate the creations of the Romanian genius to the death", an "internal revolution" against a "mechanical society".\n\nThe volume has proven to be a success among the Movement, giving further influence and intellectual backing to its radical caucus, with its emphasis on palingenetic rhetoric in the detriment of the mysticist element having further solidified Cantacuzino's standing as a Legionary theorist, and widened the intellectual horizon of the movement."
 romania.196.d:9 "A significant part of the National Peasants' Party hails from Transylvania, origin that has affected many of their members' outlooks on affairs, especially on local administration.

While quite a way off from melding the best of the Old Kingdom's administration with that of Transylvania, it is seen as a good start, and it remains to be seen how the party will follow up on the promised reforms."
 romania.227.d:9 "Following the PNT's period of consolidation and governance, the time has come to finally revise the old Constitution of 1866, a deed which was carried out. After approval by the Legislating Chambers and the Sovereign, it is expected that the people will also approve it via referendum.\n\nInfluenced both by the old constitution and the views of theorists like Constantin Stere and Romul Boilă, the new constitution devotes vast space to defining and protecting individual rights, influenced by the British concept of habeas corpus. Centralisation, though still upheld, is tempered through local autonomy on the lowest levels, and the role of popular initiatives and referenda is increased. Not all provisions survived the discussion process however; the Superior Economic Council, the Unicameral Parliament and the idea of placing land use and repartition under State control did not make the revision.\n\nIts spirit however remained unscathed, and the frontment of the PNT are sure that their new constitution will be a major step forward towards a brighter future for Romania, as the nation moves forward as one."

Upon arriving, he ordered the Special Purpose Battalion tasked with guarding the Kremlin to 'secure' the Senate Palace and ensure the 'safety' of the President with the support of the cadets.\n\nHowever, Kornilov's hubris proved to be his downfall as much as it was Boldyrev's before him. When only a portion of the Security Battalion agreed to follow his orders, fierce fighting soon broke out within the Kremlin as Kornilov's forces tried to arrest the soldiers who refused to obey orders, claiming that they were loyal only to Savinkov.\nMuch of the Kremlin complex fell rapidly. Smashing through the gates of the Spasskaya Tower, Kornilov's troops reached the Senate Palace, where they were finally stopped by dogged loyalist resistance by the MVD troops long enough for reinforcements to arrive from the capital's garrison. It was said that Savinkov followed the fighting within the Kremlin with glee on his face, but it is more plausible that he had already left the complex by this point.\n\nKornilov himself was wounded by a grenade and taken prisoner in the Senate Palace, while the rest of the mutineers were shot on the spot.

But the problems were quick to arise during the war: inefficient military production, lacking growth of heavy industry, lack of centralisation of resources.\n\nCalls for further centralisation have not been heeded by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government, however. Instead, the government began a number of political and economic reforms led by the young and illustrious Aleksey Matveyevich Rumyantsev. Rumyantsev made much of his career in the wartime economic department, and has led the rebuilding programme in Ukraine and Belarus with the hope of building a 'lasting socialism'.\n\nWhile he is hardly the only man behind the proposed reforms, he has become a sort of face for the political economy of modern Russia. Proposals include further relaxation of the economic system and increased support for small enterprise, utilising the profit motive instead of pure production numbers, and liberalisation of the political system with the belief that now that Socialism stands triumphant, the need for coercion is becoming increasingly irrelevant."

In these Vladivostok negotiations, the Russian government promised to support us in rebuilding efforts with generous loans and technical expertise, and seeks a proper treaty to ensure our continuing cooperation.\n\nBut a more thorny issue is that of our border regions: Mongolia and Xinjiang. For Russia, Mongolia in particular is of strategic importance because of its proximity to the Trans-Siberian Railway, and it is likely they would seek at least the neutrality of Mongolia. For Xinjiang, there is less conflict, but it is possible that the Russians will try to leverage us for it."

The ensuing uproar from monarchists and legalists was quickly rejected by the Emperor, who simply declared the laws of succession obsolete and decided to ignore them. Public opinion is divided - citizens are not particularly concerned about such laws, but monarchists and even some politicians accuse the Emperor of 'childishness' and outright violation of laws.\n\nDespite this, today the wedding took place in the Kremlin Cathedral of the Dormition. Vladimir and Leonida exchanged rings three times, then knelt and exchanged wedding vows, holding wedding crowns above their heads. After they were led around the lectern, they knelt and kissed the golden cross, and after the last prayer, Vladimir and Leonida were declared husband and wife. After this, celebrations were announced throughout Russia by the Emperor, who hoped to strengthen public support for his move and overcome the monarchists' dissatisfaction with his choice."

Still, interestingly enough, a substantial number of Christian and quasi-socialist tones can be found throughout the Guominjun ranks due to Feng's faith (despite his conviction that a soldier of the Guominjun need not be a Christian). After facing near collapse battling the Fengtian Clique and the Zhili Clique in the anti-Fengtian war, Feng was forced to withdraw the Guominjun remnants to Shanxi Province, ruled by the warlord Yan Xishan.

In practice, however, Yan Xishan has promoted a statist, autocratic government along neo-Confucian lines, reflecting his fickle, authoritarian and traditionalist approach towards modernisation, no doubt influenced by his studies in Japan. Yan has so far left a mixed legacy leaving behind many half-finished reforms. His support base consists of the bureaucracy, often consisting of loyalists of questionable competence, and also the gentry with which he shares ambivalent relations.

During the expedition, he managed to secretly return home to Shanxi and built a cell around his former Jiaocheng comrades to prepare for the ultimate KMT takeover. They never got their chance, and about a decade later this secretive group remains in hiding. Qiao, it would appear, has established some contact with a broader network of KMT informants around the country, but with who and how many he keeps close to his chest.

Little more than an offshoot of the already fringe KMT remnant in Shanxi, this CSP branch represents the manifestation of the extreme of student radicalism in the province.

They grew powerful enough to organise boycotts of schools and even forced Yan to fire his loyalist faculty at the People's Normal School - handing leadership over to the students. Zhao Pilian has since become principal of the Normal School, and has assumed some form of de facto leadership of the movement.

Instead, they rely on outsiders, a mixture of Beijing-aligned merchants and German investors led by the Pekin Syndicate (governed de facto by the Ostchina-Direktorium of the AOG). These investors have mainly taken over the piaohao (investment banks) that used to form the backbone of Shanxi's banking empire, becoming a rival to Yan's Provincial Bank of Shanxi.

The Heart Washing Society is a product of Yan's effort at promoting a quasi-religion suitable for state interests. Despite its wide promotion, there are relatively few 'true believers', and when the government ceases to watch or mandate meetings attendance plummets. Still, the fanatics of the society continue to meet and this reactionary movement serves as a reminder of Yan's interests in fundamentally reforming society from the bottom up.

Yang is a native of Shaanxi and was a minor Guominjun commander under Sun Yue, through grew in prominence after the Guominjun's retreat into his home province. Hiding in the mountains of Shaanxi, they have nominally submitted to Yan's rule as the \"Shaanxi Army\" though in practice operate independently - hoping to preserve their once mighty army's autonomy. This has not shielded Yang from criticism, however, as many see even his nominal cooperation as a deep betrayal of the Guominjun cause even as he claims this is a necessary evil to protect his men.

Shang Zhen has splintered off with many of his men to join the Guominjun's new government, a move decried by many in the old administration as a betrayal. Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang have meanwhile carved out their own fiefdom of old-guard Shanxi clique loyalists, nicknamed the New \"Jin\" clique after the province's shorthand name.

As Shanxi's once prosperous banking community withered, the young man enrolled (like many others to come) in military schooling at Taiyuan in hopes of securing a stable living for the future. In 1904 he went to Tokyo for further military schooling, greatly inspired by the rapid progress, authoritarianism, and militarism he saw while abroad. He further met Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui, preparing a \"Blood and Iron\" society and later joining a \"Dare to Die\" corps with other Chinese revolutionaries. Returning home, he became a commander in Shanxi, which allowed him to help overthrow local Qing loyalists during the 1911 revolution.\n\nHis military and organisational skills allowed him to become the military governor of Shanxi, with de facto supremacy over the civilian governor. He survived multiple attempts to bring Shanxi under the heel of the central government, first by Yuan Shikai and then by Wu Peifu. While he demands his commanders utilise the latest in military technology and tactics, as a field commander he has a tendency to insist on holding every piece of land and micromanaging campaigns far from the front.

 SHX_country_intro_content:9 "Shanxi is a proud province with an ancient and illustrious history, said to be where Yu the Great released the waters of the Yellow River in ages past. This mountainous and isolated province has been ruled by various Chinese dynasties since antiquity, and has since come under the power of the Shanxi (or Jin) clique. Despite its name, the clique only governs the western part of Shanxi as well as parts of the neighbouring Shaanxi province. Its leader is the wily and venerable governor §PYan Xishan§!, who has ruled the province since the Xinhai revolution in 1911. His ambitious projects seeking to modernise the province have earned him some admiration and the moniker \"the Model Governor\".\n\nOnce a contender in China's fractious power games in the north, Yan backed §PYuan Shikai§! and later §PDuan Qirui§! in their efforts to stabilise their rule in the deteriorating Chinese political landscape. However, the ultimate victory of §cWu Peifu§!, §gCao Kun§! and the §PZhili clique§! atop the embers of the dying \"Beiyang\" Republic in 1928 saw §PZhang Zuolin§! forced back into Manchuria and §gFeng Yuxiang§! retreat with the §gGuominjun§! into Yan's protection. The former enemies were forced to present a united front against the growing power of the Zhili, and accepted the nominal restoration of the §cQing monarchy§! in exchange for Beijing's recognition of Yan as governor.

After deciding to cast their lot with the Kuomintang in 1926, Marshal §gFeng Yuxiang's Guominjun§! retreated into Shaanxi the following year - badly bloodied and with their organisation in tatters. Yan's defeat shortly afterwards forced the two men to come to an arrangement, and when §PWu Peifu§! sought to stamp out the GMJ once and for all, Yan publicly declared that should Feng be forced to leave China \"together we will see the world, hand in hand\". It is said that Feng in turn declared Yan was his sworn brother, solidifying the alliance.\n\nSince then their relationship has been largely symbiotic, with both larger-than-life figures promoting a seemingly complementary vision of progress. Yan's recognition by the central government in Beijing has kept the province legally protected, and his decades of deep ties with the local gentry have helped stabilise the province. Feng, a widely travelled soldier, has cultivated positive ties with the commoners and his zealous, experienced army helps guard the province's mountain passes.\n\nCombined, §PYan's Jin clique§! and §gFeng's Guominjun§! are generally referred to as the Shanxi clique, an autonomous western bastion ostensibly within the restored §cQing Empire§!.

Despite Yan's flattering nickname and Feng's idealistic rhetoric, the territory of the Shanxi clique is littered with half-finished or outright failed projects. Their §YTen Year plan§! to revitalise Shanxi lies largely stalled, and the province remains largely an economic backwater. Going into 1936, the same old problems of corruption, poverty and neglect will likely plague the land for at least one more year.

Taking inspiration from foreign ideologies and with plenty of time to ponder, the intellectual wing of the YCP has adopted a darwinian mentality when it comes to the realm of nations. If China is to survive into the second half of this century, it must begin a programme of mass modernisation and industrialisation. Their platform is fiercely nationalistic and anti-imperialist, seeking aggressive measures in securing the end of concessions or foreign influence. This extends to cracking down on secessionist or regionalist movements and their promotion of Han chauvinism has worried many who fear further instability. But perhaps most worrisome for this fledging republic is their desire for national unity at any cost, demanding mass ideological indoctrination and the effective implementation of a one-party state, built around what will effectively become a cult of personality behind [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nIn sum, they have clearly thought up a comprehensive slate of programmes for China, which when implemented might very well be monumental in scope. But left unsaid is their expectation of exclusivity, and in any case other parties we have begun discussions will likely distance themselves should we align with the YCP.

Born with the full name Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena, he became King of Spain for the first time from the day of his birth, given his father Alfonso VII had died a year earlier from dysentery. His mother, Maria Christina of Austria served as regent until Alfonso's ascension to the throne in 1902 on his 16th birthday.\n\nIn 1906, he married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg which while initially successful, was strained following the birth of their sons Alfonso and Gonzalo of which both inherited haemophilia, carried by the Queen. From 1914 onwards, King Alfonso had several mistresses and fathered many illegitimate children distancing himself from his wife. His involvement in explicit productions and his extramarital affairs led to him gaining the title of \"the playboy king\", deeply undermining his reputation.\n\nFor his active role in the Rif War of the 1920s, he gained the title of \"El Africano\" (\"the African\") wishing for Spain to reclaim its place in the world by colonising Africa, having lost most of its colonies in 1898 to the United States. However, the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Annual in 1921 largely discredited Alfonso given Alfonso's known involvement in the war and his disregard for the soldiers fighting there. When asked about the battle's outcome, he replied that \"chicken meat is cheap\" as he continued his game of golf.\n\nIn 1923, with the government's credibility diminishing rapidly, especially due to the Rif War, Captain General Miguel Primo de Rivera launched a coup installing a military government. Fortunately for Alfonso, this kept his position secure while also resulting in a miraculous period of economic growth. Within just a decade however, the turn towards stagnation would see de Rivera's regime fall and a new republic declared.

The Armament Department was forced to adapt to these disastrous circumstances and reluctantly invited several of these key warlords to join the government.\n\nYang since then strove to rebuild his authority over Sichuan, but faced great resistance from the newly emboldened warlords, as well as opportunists within his own clique such as the Confucian general Liu Cunhou and the leader of the bandit suppression army, Tian Songyao. Much of the department doubts if Yang can maintain this moribund, decentralised government much longer.

The fact that Xiang has managed to keep his hold over south-eastern Sichuan as well keep his countless men paid and fed is testament to this fact.\n\nAfter being passed up for governorship of Sichuan and left bereft of any recognition from the Zhili Clique he had once so loyally served, Liu Xiang turned his attention towards taking what he declared was rightfully his, now by force and cunning. He has pushed for genuine modernisation and economic reforms, caring little for short term profits from bandit and opium selling when there is so much more up for grab, should the Industrial Corps successfully expand their influence over Sichuan.

Lacking the national respect and loyalty of the Jade Marshal, Wang has always played second fiddle to Wu Peifu. Yet Wang was perhaps the only man Wu Peifu feared, for he genuinely threatened his position within the Zhili Clique, having been a companion of Cao Kun longer than Wu had been. Putting everything on the line to aid his mentor, Wang would ultimately be relegated to soft retirement due to Wu's machinations, resulting in Wang's treachery in the Beijing Coup of 1924.\n\nReturning to the fold during the third ZhiFeng War, Wang would prove himself to be President Cao Kun's most loyal advocate within military circles, acting as his mouthpiece and an ever present reminder of the King of Baoding's looming network over the military apparatus. And on that day, Wang was one of the few suspicious of the buildup towards the eventful coup attempt, colluding with the Jade Marshal over reports of strenuous troop manoeuvres. And yet he could feasibly do nothing to save his mentor, or the reviled Wu Peifu. Consumed by himself, he would nonetheless order a relentless counter-attack attempting to squash the rebellion before it gained any steam.\n\nUltimately futile, now here he is, a vengeful spirit, a dead man walking. Having shot up to the forefront of the Zhili Hierarchy, Wang commands the admiration of the full essence of the Jinbao Clique, and even some members of the Luoyang Clique curry favour with the Marshal of Tianjin. Utilising his now legendary status, Wang managed to force the civilians under Yan Huiqing to kowtow to the military's primacy in such an emergency situation.

 OTT_SYR_Centralise_Infrastructural_Maintenance_desc:9 "The 'Devlet Demiryolları Umum Müdürlüğü', or State Railways Administration, which was founded during the early twenties and incorporates a vast portion of the Anatolian Railway Network, will be expanded to maintain and extend the Northern Portion of the Hejaz Railway.\n\nTaking over from a wide plethora of smaller companies and foreign concessions, this will greatly increase the efficiency of our targeted railway expansion and will make it easier for Kostantiniyye to exert its authority over the vast territories it governs in the Levant."
 OTT_SYR_Ensure_Demographic_Balance_desc:9 "Unregulated Jewish immigration under the auspices of the International Council formed one of the main reasons for the explosion of violence in the region during the year preceding the Ottoman-Egyptian war and remains a complicated debate in the region. Although the Ottoman government had already attempted to regulate the influx of Zionists prior to the Weltkrieg, it now finds itself after decades of mismanagement presented with a fait accompli. Hundreds of thousands of Zionist settlers have found a home in Palestine and with many siding with our government during the war, Kostantiniyye is uninterested in uprooting the Jewish population.\n\nNonetheless, the continued influx from Europe can no longer be tolerated as it would further upset the fragile peace that has only recently been reintroduced by the Porte. Therefore strict immigration restrictions will be placed on Palestine, forbidding the entry of new settlers (who will instead be redirected to other less developed region of the empire) and a deportation order of the so-called "Af Al Pi" immigrants (associated and sanctioned by the Irgun) given. Weakening the influence of this Zionist militia organisation and satisfying the immediate demands of the non-Jewish population, this should ensure stability and order in the region."
 OTT_ARA_Settle_Tribes_desc:9 "Although one of the most 'urban' regions on the peninsula, the Hejaz still suffers from an extreme lack of urbanisation. Outside cities such as Medina, Mecca and Jeddah most of the population is still of a migratory nature which makes conducting population counts, conscription and taxation nigh impossible. The sheer size of the region has made much authority impossible outside of the Hejaz railway but by consolidating the population in designated areas, Kostantiniyye hopes to more effectively exert its influence."
 OTT_ARA_Military_Mission_to_ARA_desc:9 "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to assist them in their modernisation programmes, promising great compensation. This could prove risky however as this also increases the strength of these nations with whom we may someday find ourselves at war."
 OTT_Greek_Tooltip_GUI:9 "Serving as the upper middle class, intellectuals, artisans and landowners, the Greek population of the Empire is in an interesting position within the state structure. Although the Anatolian Greeks are almost fully intertwined with their Turkish counterparts, the islands of the Aegean Coast and the special administrative unit of Cyprus are far less attached to Kostantiniyye.\n\nServing as hubs of §RGreek Nationalist§! rhetoric and often adhering to the dream of '§CMegali§!', these islands have proven themselves tricky to control and out of imperial control for multiple decades. Their return to the Empire after the collapse of first Italy and then the British Empire was not seen by all as a positive development and §RAnti-Ottoman§! rhetoric remains strong."
 OTT_GRE_Abolish_Mutasarrifate_desc:9 "Although an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870 when it became independent once more.\n\nA peculiar detail to the administrative status of the island is that for the authorities in Kostantiniyye, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church on the island served as the sole representative of the entire Greek community and de facto serves as their ethnic leader in most matters.\n\nWith the recent reforms however and the grandiose plans of the OHF to abolish all the special and in their belief ancient structures, the status of the island is questioned once more and it is doubtful that Kostantiniyye will continue to govern the region through a religious proxy."
 OTT_GRE_Enforce_Turkish_Curriculum_desc:9 "Through the Millet system, the various religious and ethnic minorities of our Empire were able to establish their own distinct education system. In the past this has increasingly led to anti-Ottomanist and nationalist influence creeping into the minds of our children which is proving to be a major thorn in the side of the centralist administration.\n\nEradicating the issue straight at the roots through a standardised curriculum established in Kostantiniyye, we hope to combat this movement and bring the focus back to the Ottomanist ideal. This is sure to anger a vast portion of the Greek population who will see this as an attempt to Turkify their lands and might lead to violent protest should we not be careful."
 OTT_Kurd_Tooltip_GUI:9 "The relationship between Kostantiniyye and the Kurdish population of Eastern Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia has always been a precarious one filled with both cooperation and conflict. When the last Kurdish Princely Houses were dismantled in 1847-48 and Kurdistan was formally placed under direct rule from Kostantiniyye, a loss of native tradition and leadership occurred which has had catastrophic effects for the Kurds. The absence of authority to keep §RTribal Sheiks§! and §RFanatical Religious Leaders§! at bay, led to their increased power in the Eastern Vilayets and years of massacres throughout the region against non-Sunni citizens such as the §CArmenians§! or the §CAlevi§!.\n\nDuring the rule of §YAbdulhamid II§! and the last years of the §YCUP Autocracy§!, these were freely employed to massacres the §CArmenians§! or to restore order to unruly parts of the Empire and although aversion by the post-war establishment towards these practices is increasing, they still rule the Kurds as their allies such as the §YSufi order of the Naqshbandi§! hold vast §RInfluence§! in the capital and the Empire in general.\n\nThe autonomy they are currently enjoying however is a curse in disguise as the §YOHF§! has clearly shown their intentions to eradicate the regional power of these religious authorities and is planning to fundamentally change the freedom the §RKurdish Sheiks§! currently possess."
 OTT_KUR_Increase_Ottoman_Gendarmerie_desc:9 "Serving as our main force of peacekeepers, the Ottoman Gendarmerie or Zaptı, already maintains a sizeable presence in Kurdistan to secure the protection of its citizens and the interests of Kostantiniyye. The vast distances and the low population density have spread our current force to its limits as reports of unrest close to the Armenian and Georgian borders are forced to go unanswered. Rising religious fanaticism as a reaction to the secularist reforms of the OHF has been left unchecked as well, as demagogues call for the end of their heretical rule."
 OTT_KUR_Abolish_the_Hamidiye_desc:9 "Created by Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1891, the Hamidiye was originally based on the Russian Cossacks to serve as border patrol on the Ottoman-Russian border. Their usage however quickly diverged from this purpose as they were employed to shut down Armenian nationalist and socialist revolutionaries. Partaking in a wide plethora of punitive actions and massacres on the Armenian population, the Hamidiye became known for their violence and corruption as they enriched themselves greatly. Through these actions, they were also able to achieve a wide degree of influence within Kurdistan, often positioning themselves above the Law and roaming the region with impunity.\n\nThroughout the Weltkrieg, they were able to increase this power even further as they played a key role in the Armenian Massacres. Post-war however, their power started to wane as the lack of Armenians to suppress and the increasing animosity between the Kurds and Kostantiniyye led to an increasing presence of Ottoman troops to pacify the region. Many former Hamidiye were forced to disintegrate and flocked to the banners of religious demagogues, bolstering the ranks of the conservative and extremist resistance to the Kemalist designs."
 OTT_IRQ_Abolish_Assyrian_Autonomous_Zone_desc:9 "Established through the Basra Accords in 1920, the Assyrian community was granted special status in the Vilayet of Basra. Serving as the conductor for British influence in the entire Persian Gulf, they were able to prosper and slowly but surely build a new life far away from their homeland on the plains of Nineveh. This status however is not liked by all as the government in Kostantiniyye has desperately been trying to abolish it for years now.\n\nWith tensions rising across the globe and the Assyrian question once more coming to the forefront of Ottoman politics in Iraq, some are pushing for a direct resolution to the issue and the immediate abolishment of the zone, restoring the region to the full authority of the Baghdadi Wali."
 OTT_IRQ_Mosul_Development_desc:9 "Less so than the Arab cities in Syria, the city of Mosul and its surroundings are closely connected to the Turkish economy and are more tightly knit into the regional administration of Anatolia. Furthermore, its population also consists of a tapestry of different ethnicities and religions: Kurds from the east of the Vilayet, Turkomans from the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, Turks and Jews in Mosul and Arabs throughout the entire region. The growing importance of oil for the Ottoman (war) economy however has led many in Kostantiniyye to believe that extra measures should be taken to ensure that should war return to the region, Mosul will clearly throw its lot in with the Turks and that control over Kirkuk can under no circumstances be lost.\n\nRapid expansion of the railroads in the region, linking Mosul to Diyarbakir and Kirkuk are vital in this whilst the arsenals of Iraq (usually located in Baghdad) should in some capacity be shifted to Mosul and Kirkuk. Fears of a Fifth Column amidst the Shiite Arabs of Southern Iraq and the Assyrians in Basra are further influencing government policy to take control over the region in its own hands."
 OTT_IRQ_Coordinate_Shia_Tourism_desc:9 "Some of the Holiest places in the Shiite sect of Islam are located in Iraq. Much like Sunnis travel to Mecca and Medina, many Shiites (mainly Iranians) embark on a journey to the cities of Najaf and Karbala. This both brings us an advantage and a disadvantage, as whilst these centres of faith are exerting tremendous influence on the Iraqi population, whose composition has now drastically shifted in favour of Shiite demographic domination, they also provide us with a special way to influence Iranian policy. Many influential imams and religious officials are educated at these sites and those that remain in Iraq still exert their influence over the Iranian realm as proven by events in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWith relations deteriorating with our Eastern neighbour however, many in Kostantiniyye believe that it would beneficial to our regime to tighten restrictions on Persian pilgrims travelling to the cities and to bring the educational facilities located there under closer supervision of the government."
 OTT_Libya_Tooltip_GUI:9 "Actually consisting of three distinct regions, the §Y'Regency of Tripolitania'§! has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty and lack of a decent agricultural base made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. Nonetheless, what the Italians would refer to as "§CLibya§!" formed a vital piece in the Trans-Saharan trade as the oases of Fezzan were the last stop before the Sahel. The sheer size of the region ensured that Ottoman control was barely felt outside of a few coastal centres and it would take until the American invasion in the early 19th Century before the Porte would finally take measures to tie it further to the crown.\n\nThe implementation of the §YTanzimat Reforms§! saw little success in the region as only in Tripolitania much progress could be recorded. It would take until the turn of the century before the changes of the Ottoman regime would start to infiltrate the interior but even then, §CFezzan§! and §CCyrenaica§! were left almost entirely untouched.\n\nThe Italian invasion in 1911 did little to affect the general social structure in the region as the Ottomans notables which governed the coastal strip returned from their exile and retook their place in society. As Ottoman attention was drawn to the Mashriq and saddled with the economic depression caused by the Weltkrieg, the region saw §Rlittle economic development§!. §RIlliteracy§! (outside the main cities) is higher than anywhere else in the Empire, the economy still largely depends on the rainfall in a given year and the few industrial operations running before the war have almost all been forced to close down as a §Rlack of export partners and resources§! makes anything but limited agriculture nigh-impossible."

 OTT_congress_turkish_nationalists_desc:9 "The group of 'Turkish Nationalists' is hard to pin down as whilst the majority of them resides within the OHF, a group of deputies with more radical ideas and who want to see a split between the Arab and Turkish parts of the empire have separated themselves.

To create order in this myriad of ethnicities, religious affiliations and languages, these deputies have organised in 2 main power blocs: The centralist §COHF§! and the decentralist §CLiberal Entente§!.

 OTT_Settle_Sudanese_Issue_desc:9 "The question of Sudan's future has for a while now bothered the government in Kostantiniyye, as unlike Egypt, there is very little connection between it and the Ottoman centre. The distance further complicates affairs as any effective communication is basically impossible. Therefore the idea now on the table proposes the creation of a separate Sudanese state tightly bound to the Porte."
 OTT_Eastern_Anatolian_Project_desc:9 "Just like the Americans conquered the Frontier through the iron beasts of the industrial era, so has our government decreed the expansion of rail and other roads into Eastern Anatolia. Around these railroads would then be created a system of villages and towns inhabited by Turks or immigrants of both the Balkans and the Caucasus to strengthen the hold of Kostantiniyye over their own "Frontier"."
 OTT_Multi_Level_Democracy_FEV_desc:9 "Faith in Konstantiniyye has been shattered as of late and with that a precipitous rise of extortion, tax-evasion, and bribery. The provincials have been neglected for far too long as the upper echelons of government have writhed with a revolving door of administrations. Now the state will make a bold push towards transparent governance and regardless of cost or effectiveness the people will be made to see our earnest commitment to cleaning up the provinces."
 OTT_Grand_Vizier_Arslan_desc:9 "A Druze prince from the region of Lebanon, Shakib Arslan is well known in conservative circles as Amir al-Bayān ("Prince of Eloquence") and plays a key role in the islamist movement of the empire. Although it may be seen as shocking that a non-Turk was able to achieve the office of Grand Vizier, it is also a clear signal of Kostantiniyye that the growing Arab movement needs a powerful answer."
 OTT_Mosque_Renovation_Program_desc:9 "Home to the holiest places in all Islam, the Ottoman Empire has in the last few decades nonetheless often shirked its duty to maintain these places of worship and ensure their further development. Mosques in Diyarbakir, Damascus, Baghdad, Kostantiniyye and even in the Hejaz itself are showing clear signs of neglect. We will no longer stand for this rejection of our traditions!"
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb_desc:9 "Although lost almost a century ago, the various Muslim states of the Maghreb still look towards Kostantiniyye for guidance, paying their respects to the Caliph.

 OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions_desc:9 "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on poorly-trained tribal militias. These nations have now requested experts from Kostantiniyye to aid them in their modernisation programmes, promising great compensation. The programme, which hopes to strengthen the Muslim bloc, serves also as an important political tool as sending Kemalist officers could strengthen domestic control over the army."
 OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania_desc:9 "Consisting of three distinct regions, the 'Regency of Tripolitania' has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Kostantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. With the importance of the Western flank rising and the threat posed by the remaining Senussi real, the time has come to rein Libya back in."
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_desc:9 "Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen as a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Kostantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs."

 OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology_desc:9 "Although the Ottoman Empire boasts a fair selection of institutes for higher learning, there is a severe lack of technical expertise in the realm, which has severely complicated the industrialisation of the empire.

Striving for a policy of Pan-Islamism, the faith was seen as the metaphorical glue holding the empire together under the Sultan-Caliph himself.\n\nThis control however has come at a cost as by bringing Islam closer to the chest, it as well now influences state policy at a higher level with various large Sufi orders possessing incredible political capital and opposing many of the attempted secularist reforms."

 ottpol.4.d:9 "Speaking to editors of both Kostantiniyye and international papers, the Grand Vizier has given a statement on the success of the vote and the expansion of the Ministry. "The decision taken by the Ottoman Parliament today is what the nation had wanted, naturally and genuinely. There is no need to look at it as something extraordinary." Showing off the stack of letters he had received from intellectuals all over the empire, the Pasha has once again shown to the international press that the people stand behind him. Whether or not this is actually the case is left vague and opposition papers are already describing vividly how this is an affront to the proud traditions of our state."
 ottpol.9.d:9 "The slow rate of progress, the stubborn adherence to what they describe as backwards traditions and the incessant obstruction of large scale reforms in the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate) by the Sultan is pushing parliament to a breaking point. Members of the OHF are on the throats of the opposition and are calling onto the Grand Vizier to request early elections from the Sultan to settle the disputes once and for all.\n\nMeanwhile on the streets of Kostantiniyye representatives have been forced to travel with an armed guard as supporters of both sides are reacting violently to the rising tensions. The conservative representative of Konya was attacked in the streets earlier this week as a group of 6 men armed with daggers attempted to force themselves a way through the crowds. The representative was able to escape unscathed but gendarmerie in the city remain on high alert for any further political actions."
 ottpol.18.d:9 "The resignation of our Grand Vizier and the parliamentary deadlock has led to early elections. Fears of widespread voter fraud and reports of fear tactics in the hinterlands of Anatolia are running rampant as the liberal elite of Kostantiniyye are fully aware that another victory for the OHF may usher in a return to the CUP autocracy."
 ottpol.25.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniyye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the recent plot on the Grand Viziers life. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former CUP member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the Grand Vizier has reached such levels that a number of his close friends and associates such as Prince Osman Fuad, Ismet Pasha, Ali Fuad Pasha and even Chief of Staff Fevzi Pasha have tried calling the man to reason.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from complicity in the assassination, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more it seems likely that the trials will be solely used as a political play to silence the opposition than to punish those responsible for the plot against the Pasha."
 ottpol.41.d:9 "What many feared would come has been confirmed earlier today as Fevzi Pasha has officially declared the state of emergency postponing elections indefinitely and closing parliament until further notice. Having both the army and a large part of the OHF network on his side, it seems unlikely that this will only be for a short duration and many fear that a military dictatorship may be here to stay after the assassination of the Grand Vizier only a few weeks earlier. To counter possible resistance in the outer vilayets all Walis have been recalled to the capital to discuss further policy and likely be replaced by military men loyal to the new regime. Over in Kostantiniyye itself, Ismet Pasha has been appointed Grand Vizier to ensure a steady hand in day to day affairs but within the political circles it is clear to most that he has mostly been appointed to the position as a puppet for Fevzi's regime."
 ottkem.4.d:9 "Created as an overarching organisation to protect the Turkish language, much like the Académie Française for the French language, the Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association) has been opened in Kostantiniyye today by the Sultan. Serving and combining the efforts of the Turkish Language Committee into one distinct entity, leadership of this new institution was given to Hagop Martayan. From Armenian descent, Secretary-General Hagop served in the Ottoman army during the Weltkrieg where he met Pasha. Leaving the Empire in 1921, he went on to teach Turkish at the university of Sofia before being summoned by Kemal to the language conference held earlier this year in the capital.\n\nCurious to note as well is the negotiations held between the government and the Türk Ocakları (Turkish Hearts), a Turkish nationalist organisation, concerning the institution and possible cooperation between the two to examine the root of the Turkish language and the history of its people. Talks seem to have broken down however as Hamdullah Suphi, president of the organisation, could be seen leaving the Sublime Porte in anger refusing to speak to the press."
 ottkem.5.d:9 "As literacy rates steadily rise across the empire and more and more students enrol in the universities of our grand nation, many have brought up the need for a new institution to supplement the Darülfünûn-u Sahâne (Imperial University) in Kostantiniyye. A variety of Law, Medical and Technical schools already exist throughout the Empire, most notably in Beirut, Damascus and Baghdad. Serving as a token of our modernist reforms, technological innovation and the future of the Ottoman people, debate rages over its location as many prominent cities have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nAdana, the pearl of Southern Anatolia, has established itself as a key industrial region over the last few decades, further increased by its strategic location close to the Suriye vilayets.\n\nSmyrna, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Greek and Turkish culture is one of the most developed and largest cities in the Empire and has long been seen as both an intellectual and economical hub of the Porte.\n\nTucked away in Iraq, the city of Mosul has seen its importance skyrocket in recent years as the export of oil from the Mesopotamian Vilayets exponentially increases. Close Ottoman supervision over the region, further aided by the Turkoman population and connections through the Berlin-Baghdad railway, has made it a veritable hub of the new Ottoman movement as its choice would be seen by many as a further attempt by the Porte to bring the region under its wing."
 ottkem.8.d:9 "When the Millet system was founded according to the national legend in the 15th Century under Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, the idea behind it was that as Muslim citizens were governed by Islamic Law, so should Christians and other religious minorities be governed according to the laws of their own faith. It is unclear whether or not the system was actually in use before the 19th Century when Sultan Mahmud II split his non-Muslim subjects up in three distinct Millets: Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Jewish.\n\nBowing under international pressure, the Empire was forced to cede more and more power to these bodies after the Tanzimat reforms of the late 19th Century as the various great powers saw it as their sworn duty to protect the various minority groups of the Empire. As the Millet system allowed for a plethora of special powers such as the collection of taxes and the creation of new laws for the community, the citizens of these groups became less Ottoman by the day, as the Europeans started influencing their day-to-day life more and more, effectively attempting to wrangle them away from our Empire.\n\nPressured by the outside world, we had no choice but to watch as the power of Kostantiniyye over the Millets was reduced to practically nil. Efforts by the Young Turks to fight back against the system and to abolish the dreaded Capitulations which allowed European subjects in the Empire to be governed according to European law were only partially successful, as none of the Powers were willing to give up its vast influence within our Empire.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg, however, brought a glimmer of hope for the reformists of the Empire, as with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Turkish sons, the dreaded Capitulations were finally abolished, as such ushering in a new era of reform for the Eternal State.\n\nThe Millet system has survived regardless, as indecisive politics in the Ottoman Parliament, and the need of both coalitions to attract the Christian and Jewish vote have thus far thwarted any attempt at reform."
 ottkem.13.d:9 "The Sublime Committee for Constitution has been working tirelessly to write our new Constitution. The Parliament has started the process of approving the independent Articles and submitting them for ratification by His Majesty the Sultan.\n\nArticle 1. The Ottoman Empire comprises present territory and possessions, and semi-dependent provinces. It forms an indivisible whole, from which no portion can be detached under any pretext whatever.\n\nArticle 2. Kostantiniyye is the capital of the Ottoman Empire. This city possesses no privilege or immunity peculiar to itself over the other towns of the empire."
 ottkem.27.d:9 "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders, such that the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state however came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniyye and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to break of the Kemalist reforms.\n\nConsisting of a wide plethora of orders ranging from the Mevlevi tarikat or "Whirling Dervishes" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led them to become kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his hand and his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of his Vizier."
 ottkem.39.d:9 "Calling themselves the 'Black Hand', a paramilitary organisation was uncovered in Eastern Anatolia, while they attempted to rally support in the countryside around Erzurum. The organisation, pleading for a strict moral adherence to the Quran and the Sharia code, seems to be in large part recruiting from the demobilised Army of Islam with which Enver Pasha descended on the Caucasus after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\n\nAlthough not a separatist organisation and with self-proclaimed loyalty to the Caliph, their intentions are clearly targeted at overthrowing the OHF administration and restoring the executive powers of the Sultan-Caliph. Many Kurdish Sheikhs and Aghas, who see in their cause a way to retain their positions now that has become apparent that Kostantiniyye will enforce direct rule over the region, have been rumoured to associate themselves with the organisation and even pleaded military support should the need arise.\n\nNonetheless, their early discovery by government agents has severely limited their potential, as the first wave of arrests and executions is cutting away the head of the snake. Granting an excuse to the Walis of Eastern Anatolia to interfere more directly with Kurdish affairs, gendarmerie and army detachments have also been sent in to replace the affiliated Sheikhs with government agents."
 ottkem.40.d:9 "Troubling news arose earlier this week as the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti started picking up the trail of a conspiracy against the Sultan and the government in general. Consisting of a radicalised core of former CUP supporters, an anonymous source tipped off the Kostantiniyye police warning them of a coming plot to assassinate both the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, assert control over the Porte and crown a new Sultan subservient to their cause. Amongst the conspirators various members of the old CUP Teskilât-i Mahsusa (Special Organisation) of Enver Pasha, many still placed in high positions within the army and security forces. The size of the network is hard to estimate, as bad communication with the Eastern provinces where various groups loyal to Envers former Army of Islam still roam, hindering the gendarmerie's ability to conduct a full investigation."
 ottkem.60.d:9 "Praising the virtue and bravery of the Ottoman soldiers on the frontlines fighting for the honour of the Empire, the Grand Vizier has called upon parliament to provide a unified statement of praise at the address of the Sultan congratulating him with the victories of his troops. Hammering down on the shared duty to the Ottoman state and its Sultan every single one of them shares, he has subsequently requested that Parliament be temporarily dismissed until the war is over and that he be granted full executive powers to guide the nations during these trying times. How can one, he continues, have an issue with the Exalted Sultan and per extension his Council of Ministers during this crisis and how could there be disagreement in a cause so righteous and noble?\n\nAnswered by the ear-shattering applause from his supporters, and the rise of representatives from all across the Empire to outdo the other in singing their praise of the most Exalted of Sultans and his loyal servant, a vote on the proposal was called at once and answered by nigh unanimous support from both sides as members of the opposition fear that rising their voice against a cause so patriotic and so just may paint them as enemies of the State and traitors to our beloved Caliph.\n\nAs word of the parliamentary agreement spread to the streets of Kostantiniyye and the letter of praise is proclaimed to the roaring patriotic crowds gathered in front of the building (some say as part of an organised action by the OHF), tears spontaneously spring up in the eyes of the bystanders as the excitement and enthusiasm of the people spreads to both sides of the Bosporus."
 ottkem.63.d:9 "The nation stands victorious atop the corpse of the Bulgarian state, successfully wrestling back control over its lost territories. Throughout Western Thrace the army is hailed as heroes, and sons of Osman himself, as in Kostantiniyye the triumph of Mustafa Kemal is supreme. From his actions in the Italian-Ottoman war to his valiant defence at Gallipoli to his role in the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, there can be no more doubt of his skill and patriotism.\n\nAlthough not originally envisioning a campaign into the Balkans in his designs for the nation, the re-conquest of the lost sons of Osman has made him nigh untouchable within the Ottoman political sphere. All eyes are on him, Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, now as the opposition tries to garner what support it has to prevent this man from disabling them indefinitely."
 ottkem.64.d:9 "During the Dark Years of the Empire when its borders were under assault from all sides, massive population displacements occurred in the Balkans, as from one day upon another hundreds of thousands of Muslims found themselves in a nation overtly hostile to their existence. Endless caravans of refugees were forced to leave the former Ottoman territories after its humiliating defeats and tried to find a new home on the edges of the capital from where the Ottoman government tried to resettle them across Anatolia.\n\nMany of these people forced out of their homes in a war they often played no part in have seen in the recent re-conquest of Bulgarian territory to finally return home, and have been encouraged to do so by Kostantiniyye, who desires to deport as many Bulgarians out of her territory as possible. To make room for these people, the government has confiscated vast swathes of land from Bulgarian landowners to distribute amongst its citizens.\n\nNot unsurprisingly, the Bulgarian people living on the land are opposing the government wherever they can, as skirmishes between Muslim Turks and Bulgars are daily occurrences throughout the region. To answer the growing crisis and to restore public order to these new acquisitions of the Empire, the army has requested a mandate to restore order, by force if necessary. Foreign response has been openly negative to the deportations and some more cautious members of our government are requesting us to tone down the scale of the operations to avoid creating the scene for a European intervention, not unlike those seen throughout the 19th Century."
 ottfev.5.d:9 "Never a man of much public display, the popularity of the Marshal amongst the Turkish troops has increased tremendously lately as his dedication to crushing shadowy cabals and eliminating all glaring and conspicuous signs of corruption has been received exceptionally well. Originating amongst the Kostantiniyye garrison, a soldier's song honouring the Marshal seems to have spread to most of the Turkish divisions by now and has been received well by the Marshal himself as well.\n\n"Mareşal biz buradayız!" or "Marshal, here we are!", the song is an interesting addition to the military music repository with many of the older songs referring to the lengthy and costly campaigns in Yemen or other tragic events in the military history of the empire."
 ottfev.7.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniyye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the “political coup against democracy”. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former CUP member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the military establishment has reached new highs.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from trumped-up bribery claims, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more, it seems likely that the trials will be used more as a political play to silence the opposition rather than to punish those responsible for the disruption of law and order."
 ottlib.7.d:9 "As the deportations of Armenians and Greeks increased during the Weltkrieg and the death count started to ramp up, their possessions were usually left behind and confiscated by local Muslims. To deal with the growing amount of abandoned houses and other properties, these were ultimately placed under the regulations of the Abandoned Properties Laws and made possession of the state until the original owner could return and prove his ownership. During the war however, these properties were used as payment and enticement for local Kurds and other Muslims for their contribution to the war and the deportations in specific.\n\nAs the war came to an end and many of the Armenians deported along the Homs-Hama-Damascus route returned to Cilicia, the new owners of these properties were evidently less interested in returning these. A commission was sent from Kostantiniyye to solve the issue and peacefully assist in the restitution of these properties but heavy opposition from the local Muslim residents, boosted by the efforts of local CUP leaders such as Taşçızâ de Abdullah, Kethüdazâde Hüseyin Cemil Bey, Mamat Ağazâde Ali Effendi, the Kurd Hacı Osman Agha and Hafız Şahin Effendi, ultimately forced them to withdraw despite the pleas of the Central Service of Armenian Repatriation. The Armenians in question would ultimately be painted as traitors to the Ottoman Empire, enemies of the state and willing collaborators of the Entente occupation in 1918-1919.\n\nThe Armenian deputies never stopped fighting for restitution however and with their hopes invested in the HIF to finally give them back their land, they have seen in the recent sales of Miri land an opportunity to receive a fair compensation for their losses during the war. Many Muslims deputies however are firmly opposed to these ideas, with members from the OHF often even going as far as saying that this is their reward for the treachery during the war. This has prompted the Armenian deputies to lose their patience with the coalition as their inability to take a decisive stance on the issue has now led to an ultimatum. Either their people are compensated or all Armenians will withdraw from the coalition."
 ottlib.14.d:9 "The DF has recently seen a growth in popularity, mainly on the Anatolian periphery, amongst the lower educated population. Usually voting for the policies of Mustafa Kemal, this came as a surprise both in the headquarters of the OHF as the DF. Trying to find an explanation for this phenomenon, some observers have found a connection related to the name of the party itself.\n\nThe party's logo, a galloping white horse, comes from the strong resemblance of the foreign word Demokrat to the Turkish words Demir Kırat, "Iron Kırat". The horse Kırat was a character in popular Turkish legend; it was the horse and trusted companion of Köroğlu, a Robin Hood-type hero who championed the causes of the common people against the oppressive regime. Demokrat and Demir Kırat were often interchanged by the peasantry. Some have pointed out that the peasantry began to view the Democrat Party as the supernatural hero protecting their rights from the detached aristocrats in Kostantiniyye, just as in the folklore."
 ottlib.15.d:9 "The fabulous growth of the Ottoman economy seems to have met its endpoint, as a substantial decline to growth rates across the board are sending shockwaves from Kostantiniyye to Basra. A policy of mass spending, servicing lobbyists and poorly guided monetary management has doubled or even tripled production figures across all sectors but with the treasury going deeper and deeper into the red, many of these factories and farm estates will be forced to close the books if government intervention doesn't arrive.\n\nThe OHF has already embarked on a smear campaign to prove that their programme of a balanced budget and austerity was the only way for the Empire and that this reckless spending is what brought the OPDA down on us in the first place."
 ottlib.17.d:9 "With the monopoly on power by Turkish officers broken, and with concessions to the Provincial Assemblies to determine affairs of the army, there has been an acute increase in the formation of politico-military cliques. Consisting of officers or their family members in regions with stricter regulation and enforcement, these cliques have been working themselves towards a monopoly on power and are establishing as local strongmen in a system which some have been starting to refer to as eerily similar to that of China.\n\nMost prominent of this cliques, is the one centred around Iraqi Musir Yasin al-Hashimi, who has exploited the growing pains of the new system to place friends and family in a variety of position within the Iraqi assemblies, thus securing not just the army but also key positions regarding oil, agriculture and tribal settlement. Whilst a similar monopoly on power has thus far not occurred in Greater Syria, escalating events in Damascus are nonetheless causing great concern in Kostantiniyye."
 ottsab.31.d:9 "An old tradition of many Ottoman men, the habit of enjoying a cup of coffee with friends and acquaintances is flourishing as never before. Much like the Parisian cafés impacted the development of social thought and the arts in French culture, these houses serve as a gathering point for the Ottoman cultural elite to discuss and ponder about the issues of life, the empire and the finer arts. Whilst not all products of this are positive, complaints from many a Wali about the laziness and bad influence these places have on work ethic are almost a daily occurrence in Kostantiniyye, they are a testament of a more open and free Ottoman society."
 ottsab.32.d:9 "Ruled by Aghas and Sheiks, many of the Kurds have been embracing the turn to decentralisation with open arms. There exists however a rift between the Kurds actually living in Kurdistan and those defending their cause in the capital. The metropolitan Kurds, for the most part united in their organisation Kurdistan Ta'ali wa Taraqi Jamiyad (The Society for the Rise and Progress of Kurdistan), envision a Kurdistan free from the yoke of religion with political freedom and development rivalling that of the rest of the Ottoman Empire, but don't seem to realise that the situation on the ground is vehemently opposed to this. The Aghas and Sheikhs, who have been involved in a seemingly eternal civil war between each other, are fighting tooth and nail against the plans of the government to put power into the hands of the urban Kurds. Influenced by the Sufi orders, most notably the Naqshbandi, many of the Sheikhs have steered their tribes into open conflict with Kostantiniyye in an attempt to hold on to their power.\n\nFailed rebellion after failed rebellion, Kurdistan is slowly but surely being 'liberated' from its backwardness although many are questioning whether the cost of human life and the clear opposition of the Kurdish ruling class shouldn't be a sign to leave the region alone."
 ottsab.33.d:9 "For most of the history of our empire, land ownership was built on a system of common land which was either owned by the state and then leased to farmers who paid a tax for its use, or owned by a certain tribal federation. Whilst this had the significant disadvantage that those toiling on the fields often had little desire to increase the fertility of the land or put in much effort in general, it ensured that there were ultimately little large landowners. Reforms, started already back in the 19th century in part to encourage a more sedentary lifestyle for the still nomadic tribes, have changed this concept into one where land registration became the order of the day, and where previous common land was in rapid succession claimed by certain individuals and families, as such creating a powerful caste of land owners. Iraq and the Kurdish regions have been hit hardest by this as various tribal figures exchanged their pastoral lifestyle for the bustling cities, claiming all land previously owned by the entire tribe as their own. A massive caste of farmers through these actions became landless almost overnight and with little other choice either moved through the cities, causing trouble for the already stretched amenities of these regions, or remained on the land and became subjects of a modern form of serfdom.\n\nWith a massive push on 'self-initiative', 'decentralisation' and catering to their main electoral base, - the landowners - reforms by the liberal coalition have only aggravated the situation, leading to increased support by the impoverished lower classes for the grand aims of land reform heralded by the OHF and the rising socialist parties in the Empire. Not only is this causing a shift in the political landscape towards a more ostensibly radical point of view, revenues have seen substantial drops as well, due to widespread corruption on the provincial level and the refusal by many groups to pay their share of dues to the treasury in Kostantiniyye."
 ottars.1.d:9 "Claiming to cleanse the cabinet of trouble figures and restore public faith in the government, Arslan has embarked on a long journey to replace many of the older liberal elites with figures from the Islamist movement. Little resistance has been put up by the liberal coalition partners as fears of a complete collapse of the coalition have kept them quiet.\n\nThe intentions of the Grand Vizier are however quite clear and his multi-step programme to restore the importance of faith has already sent waves through the Chamber of Deputies. Multiple walis have also been recalled to Kostantiniyye as their 'questionable' loyalties make it hard to enforce his policy."
 ottars.11.t:9 "Coup d'État in Kostantiniyye"
 ottars.12.d:9 "Suffering from a stroke after visiting an orphanage near Bursa, the old Sultan was rushed off to Kostantiniyye for medical assistance. By the time he arrived however, the damage was already done and the wise Caliph had taken his last breath.\n\nA standing symbol of the democratic rule in the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan was one of the last obstacles left for the Pan-Islamist ambition to restore the full power of the Caliph. Although many point out that this was solely because he knew from experience how the army would react to such an authoritarian move, he nonetheless kept extremism at bay with his hands-off approach to governing.\n\nAhmed IV, a younger and less steadfast man, will take over for him and continue to steer the Porte through these turbulent times."
 otteco.3.d:9 "Crisis. Chaos. Disaster. All across the world economists and business owners are in a state of panic as the unthinkable finally happened earlier this week, when the Berlin Stock Exchange collapsed. Similar to Berlin, Kostantiniyye is on high alert for any changes to the situation as they watch the economy collapse into the ground. Nonetheless there is far less of a crisis in the Empire than many initially expected, as the protectionist nature of the empire during the '20s has formed the foundation of a structure capable of resisting most shocks on the global market.\n\nTo ensure the fears of the private sector are quelled, and to outline the next Four Year Plan envisioned by the OHFs economic partners, a second Economic Congress is planned to be held in the city of Samsun on the Black Sea (Samsun Iktisat Kongresi). Combining both projects from the private sector and showcasing the advances of the Turkish economy over the last few decades, it will not only serve as a way to calm down Ottoman investors, but also as a showcase of the modernising Ottoman nation to the world."
 ottsep.7.d:9 "Appointed by Irade during the initial days of the Hejazi Revolt, Ali Haidar Pasha of the Hashemite house had acted as Sharif of the Holy Cities for almost two decades before his death earlier this week. As the need of the office has been questioned repeatedly with most authority these days in the hands of the Hejazi Wali, some are hoping to use this opportunity to not appoint a successor and as such end the tradition.\n\nSon of Ali Haidar and raised amongst the Court in Kostantiniyye, Abdul Majid Haidar would be his successor, but has shown little desire for the position, preferring the lively streets of the capital to the dusty hills of the Hejaz."
 ottsep.11.d:9 "The province of Sulaymaniyah has always been a point of trouble for the Walis of Mesopotamia. Inhabited by a strong Kurdish majority, many of their Sheiks and Aghas refuse to implement the new reforms and concede authority to Kostantiniyye and instead hold on strongly to tribal allegiances and Kurdist tradition.\n\nTurkoman expansion towards Eastern Mesopotamia, the Assyrian exodus and the discovery of oil near Mosul and Kirkuk has upset the delicate balance of the region with various groups attempting to take control over the territory. Inside of Kurdistan, great rivalry also rules as the various tribes are involved in a near constant state of internal conflict based on family, language and sectarian lines.\n\nAs the Ottoman state has no desire to let one Kurdish group get stronger than the others or let them find a common ground besides the Padishah, this struggle is often encouraged by authorities in Mosul to the detriment of both the Kurds themselves, the remaining Assyrians, and the Turkomans who are often victims of Kurdish offensives."
 ottsep.25.d:9 "Tensions between Kostantiniyye and Teheran reached a new high this week as Persian customs detained a Dubai-flagged jalbut on its travel to the island of Greater Thunb. Sparking immediate outrage from the entire population of the Trucial Coast, in a rare display of unity for the region, a squadron of the Ottoman fleet was dispatched to the region and anchored just before the coast of the Persian city of Lingah. Sending an ultimatum to the Persian government to immediately release the passengers, who were travelling under the protection of the Sultan-Caliph, escalation ultimately brought forth a salvo from the Ottoman fleet after which the white flag was hoisted on the shore.\n\nWhilst the safe passage of Ottoman subjects in the Persian Gulf has thus been reassured (by force), many are seeing in this yet another sign of a nearing confrontation between the two former enemies. With unrest rising in Palestine and friction on the Kurdish frontier, it may even seem that this confrontation is coming sooner rather than later."
 ottsep.29.d:9 "An enclave of the Muscati state, the peninsula of Khasab is one of the most crucial positions in the Middle East. Singlehandedly having the capacity to completely cut off the strait of Hormuz, thus cutting Iran and Iraq off from the world's economy, it has been a thorn in the sight of both Kostantiniyye and Teheran. With Muscat however, forming a neutral power between the two rivalling blocs, an acceptable compromise seem to have been reached and for centuries the Sultans of the Muscati thalassocracy have been able to govern the peninsula uncontested.\n\nThe decay of the Muscati state has however not gone unnoticed, and with tensions rising between the two largest powers in the region, the peninsula has found itself a pawn in a dangerous game. The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours. This goodwill seems to have run out as naval manoeuvres by the Persian fleet around the Strait have led to a similar response from the Caliphate, bringing the two to the brink of war."
 ottfla.6.t:9 "Air Raid Drills in Kostantiniyye"
 ottfla.7.d:9 "Installed as 2nd Corps Command in Gallipoli, Nuri Paşa was so saddened by the lack of proper recognition paid to the fallen soldiers there during the Weltkrieg, he has sold his houses in Kostantiniyye, spent all his savings and has ordered the construction of a Mausoleum to honour the 16.000 Turkish boys that fell at Zığındere. Collecting the bones still largely scattered on the fields of battle, he has carefully placed them with prayers in a marble shrine.\n\nHimself having served as a junior officer during the Weltkrieg on the Gallipoli front, he hopes that with this action their deeds will be immortalised and they will be seen as the martyrs they truly were."
 ottfla.11.d:9 "Seen as one of the most vital technological advancements of our era, the Ottoman government has always had a keen interest in the field of aviation, as its potential for partisan suppression and quick communication are essential for maintaining the integrity of the Sublime State. Besides military applications however, there has been a growing interest into the potential of civilian transportation by air from the centre to the periphery.\n\nTo cater to this demand, the government has struck a partnership with the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers to enable the construction of licence built planes within the Ottoman Empire. Even though the Empire doesn't readily possess the technological prowess or degree of industrialisation to mass produce aircraft, this sector of the industry has been absorbed into the state directives as essential to the interests of the Ottoman state.\n\nThe current airline, operated by the Ministry of Defence, has also been rebranded into the State Airlines General Directorate and folded into the Department of Transportation. Whilst ambitious plans for an airport in Kostantiniyye have also been drafted up, the lack of funding has postponed these indefinitely with the already collected funding instead shifted towards the expansion of air strips in Baghdad, Beirut, Mecca and Misurata."

Gruesome reports of Ikhwan soldiers gutting open Ibadi resistance fighters, and the trail of destruction left in their wake (most notably in Nizwa which was burnt to the ground) has frightened the Ottoman detachment and the Sultan of Muscat alike.\n\nRauf Pasha, believing that the only way to protect Muscat is greater Ottoman commitment to the theatre, has requested further reinforcements from Basra and has drafted plans to sideline the Sultan and establish the Ottoman army as the real authority on the ground. Having lost a significant portion of their fighting power, there is little that the Muscatis can do to resist this but many in Kostantiniyye have expressed their caution at further overextension and are instead calling for a retreat towards Basra (as such leaving Muscat an easy prey for the Saudis)."

Just as in the other Christian regions of the empire though, the deportations and massacres struck deep as the Pontic Greeks were targeted by the plans of Talaat Pasha. Contrary to the Armenian population however, the majority of the Greek population survived the massacres, and although refugees have been fleeing the region ever since the start of the Weltkrieg, the recent improvements in Greek-Ottoman relations and the flourishing economy have ensured a slow recovery of the pre-war Greek population.\n\nTensions remain high between the Muslim majority and the Greek minority as the latter's political status and wealth is met with jealousy from the poor Turkish inland sandjaks. This tension is also reflected in Kostantiniyye, as the Greeks flock to the banner of the OPAD in the hopes that their decentralisation programme will protect them in the future. The Turkish majority however, has found solace in the rhetoric of Mustafa Kemal, who promises a stronger Turkish people and state directed programmes to assist the impoverished Turks.§!"

During his early life, Abdülmecid enjoyed private education inside the walls of the palace, where he developed interests in music and arts. However, as per Ottoman traditions, he was not allowed to leave the palace until he had reached the age of 40. Still, he was happy, and over time grew increasingly content with the fact that he'll probably never be a Sultan.\n\nIn 1908, the year in which the Young Turk Revolution took place, Abdülmecid was finally old enough to leave the palace. He used his newfound freedoms to share his love for art and music with the world. He became the Chairman of the Ottoman Artists' Society, exhibited his paintings all over Europe, met with some of the most prominent musicians of the continent and learned to play new instruments.\n\nEven though Abdülmecid would have likely wanted to dedicate his entire life to music and arts, the world had bigger plans for him. On the 4th of July 1918, his first cousin Mehmed VI was crowned Sultan, a development which once again saw Abdülmecid become the heir apparent to the throne. After Mehmed had died 8 years later, Abdülmecid succeeded to the throne and was crowned Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of all of Islam. For most people, this would've been a dream come true - but for Abdülmecid, it was something he had never truly wanted. His apathy was one of the many reasons for why the Grand Viziers appointed during his reign managed to decrease the already diminished influence of the Sultan even further, turning him into nothing but a popular figurhead that mostly keeps away from politics, and whose main role it is to represent the Empire abroad. By now, the political power of the Sultan has come to an all-time low, and it seems unlikely, if not impossible, that this will change in the near future.§!"

However, this restriction was lifted after his grandfather had died in 1904. Because of this, Osman was able to join the Volunteer Officer Force during the Italian Invasion of Tripolitania in 1911. Even though he was only 16 years old at the time, Osman was already able to show his qualities as an officer and as a soldier. During his time in Libya, he met Mustafa Kemal, who was still only a Captain at the time and would soon become a good friend of Osman.\n\nAfter gathering his first experiences on the battlefield, Osman attended the Ottoman Military Academy. Following his graduation, he and a few of his cousins were sent to the German Military Academy in Potsdam. Afterwards, he joined the German Imperial Guard of Hussars, in which he held the rank of Captain. Once the Weltkrieg broke out, he was recalled to the Empire in order to help with its defence. Over the course of the war, he fought on many different fronts, but his most notable battles took place in Gallipoli and Benghazi. For his bravery, courage and competence in battle, he was decorated with numerous military honours, including the Gallipoli Star and the Liakat War Medals. Moreover, he was also promoted to Major-General - something truly astonishing for a 23-year-old.\n\nAfter the war had come to an end, Osman stayed in Kostantiniyye and focused on his military career. He became known throughout the realm for his skills as an officer and especially for his abilities as a cavalry commander. These skills came in handy in the aftermath of the Palace Raid, during which he managed to crush the rebels and to retake control of the capital. Because of his quick reaction, the people now see him as an efficient and trustworthy leader, that can take action when needed. However, some fear that Osman might be just another puppet of the OHF and strongly influenced by his dear friend Kemal.

 TUR_kurdish_revolt_desc:9 "Although the Kurds have been a part of our nation for centuries now, they never really felt attached to Kostantiniyye. In the past, this has often led to waves of unrest and numerous revolts in which the Kurds tried to fight for their freedom. Even though we were able to crush these revolts using our sheer military might, the stubbornness of the Kurdish people prevented us from centralising their lands. However, it should also be noted that the Kurdish people are by no means united. Their lands are split between many tribes with varying interests. The only thing that most of them can agree on is the fact that, from their point of view, Kurdistan would be better off without the Turks.\n\nOur defeat in the Levant Crisis has once again rekindled the rebellious and nationalist sentiments of the Kurds. Seeing our army being beaten gave them new hope. Now they see their time to strike. The Chiefs of the different tribes are starting to settle their disputes, the people are beginning to arm themselves and the resistance movements are growing stronger by the day.\n\nCurrent Kurdish Unrest: [?TUR_kurdish_unrest_value|R0%%]\n§R(A revolt will happen if unrest reaches [?TUR_kurdish_revolt_threshold?100|R0%%])§!"
 tur.12.d:9 "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the CUP at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders. Slowly but surely, the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state, however, came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniyye, and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HIF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to halt the Kemalist reforms.\n\nThe different orders range from the Mevlevi tarikat or "Whirling Dervishes" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat, whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led to them becoming the kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of the policies his Vizier pursues."
 tur.69.d:9 "After our defeat in the Levant Crisis, new nations arose in the entire Middle East. Among them was the young nation of Iraq, which had been a part of the Ottoman Empire since it had been conquered by Sultan Selim I in 1534. Naturally, after such a long time, the province grew quite close to Kostantiniyye. Because of this, Iraq, unlike other Arab nations, does not hate us with every fibre of their being. This gives us the opportunity to reestablish diplomatic relations with the young state and allows us to fight the influence the Egyptians have over the most eastern part of the Arab world. Conveniently, this would also give us access to the rich Iraqi oil fields and thus help boost our economy. Seeing how the Iraqis are being threatened by the Iranians, who view Iraq as an integral part of their nation, they surely wouldn't say no to a new friend in the region that could possibly help in the defence of their homeland."
 tur.100.d:9 "Kostantiniyye has been our nation's capital since it has been conquered by Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. Sadly, in the past few years Kostantiniyye has lost much of the glory and glamour that once earned it the name 'city of the world's desire'. It has become a place of political intrigue and has been corrupted by the schemes of those hungry for power. While this had also been a problem in past centuries, with numerous sultans dying prematurely or being forced to abdicate the throne, the situation developed into a nightmare as the end of the Empire drew closer. The general political instability in the capital, which had been amplified by the outbreak of the Levant Crisis, has caused numerous assassination attempts, the formation of various secret organisations and a general mistrust and dissent in the population.\n\nA few weeks back, [TUR.GetLeader] and his government have decided that this polluted and corrupted city should no longer be considered the home of the Turkish people. Instead, they think the capital of the Turkish state should lie in the hills of Anatolia, in the city of Ankara. Its central position makes the city both of strategical and of geopolitical importance, and ensures that our citizens living on our eastern border no longer feel like they're being ruled from a capital that lies far away on the other side of the world. While some have pointed out that Ankara is a relatively poor city and should thus not represent the entire nation of Turkey, [TUR.GetLeader] insists on his decision, arguing that relocating our capital into the area will foster the economic growth of the city. Furthermore, he has also planned the expansion of the Ankara's infrastructure in order to make it more appealing to the outside world."

He also joined the CUP, however didn't want to partake in the Young Turk Revolution, which wasn't received very well by the other members, forcing him to leave the organisation.\n\nBefore the Weltkrieg, he was stationed in Rumelia and Yemen, where he was able to achieve major successes while negotiating with the natives, resulting in his promotion to the rank of major. He also served in the Balkan Wars, both as an officer on the front and as a military advisor during the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople, which formally ended the Second Balkan War. Throughout the Weltkrieg, the Pasha fought on many different fronts, including Gallipoli, the Caucasus, and Syria, earning himself the rank of colonel.\n\nAfter the war, Ismet embraced his role as the right-hand man of the famous "Lion of Antep", which also helped boost his own popularity. During the reign of the OHF, he supported Kemal in pushing through some of his most radical reforms, highlighting his secularistic and centralist notions. Now that Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Ismet's dearest friend, has passed away, he has taken it upon himself to fulfil the wishes of the Gazi and to turn his dreams into reality. Although following in the footsteps of a man such as Kemal will certainly not be an easy task, the party, and thereby the people, trust and respect Ismet and have chosen him to become the first president of the Turkish Republic, putting their future into his hands.

Afterwards, he served in Serbia and Albania, where he first made contact with members of the CUP. The Balkan War saw Fevzi serving as the Director of the 1st Division in the Western Army, where he was able to achieve some successes, but ultimately had to accept the defeat of the Empire.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Pasha achieved his first major victories, the most notable of which being the battle of Gallipoli, during which he commanded the V Corps. Later on, he also served on the Caucasian front and in Palestine. To honour his military achievements, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1918. However, just a month after his promotion, he had to return to Kostantiniyye because of a sudden illness. There, on Christmas Eve, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Ottoman Empire. After the war, Fevzi embraced his role as a war hero and began to climb the ranks of the military ladder once more, with him being appointed Field Marshal at the recommendation of his dear friend Mustafa Kemal only a few years after the war's conclusion. During the post-war period, he stayed mostly in the background and refrained from interfering in the political matters of the state, instead focusing on the repression of partisans.\n\nThe recent political developments, however, have made him change his mind. Seeing the chaotic state the party was in, Fevzi deemed them unfit to rule, and now that he has secured his grasp over the nation, he plans on following his own visions, hoping to bring order and stability, not just to the party, but to the entire nation of Turkey.§!"

Having completed his education, Recep did not have to wait long to test his abilities as a soldier and commander. From 1911 to 1913, he fought in Yemen, Tripolitania, and the Balkan Wars. Once the Weltkrieg broke out, he was assigned to the Caucasus front, where he had to face off against the Russians.\n\nAfter the war's conclusion, Recep decided to no longer focus on his military career, choosing to pursue one in politics instead. He joined the OHF and became part of the radical wing of the party, which at the time was considered the political underdog. Like many other members of the radical wing, he grew increasingly attached to the ideas of the Kadro newspaper and began to incorporate them into his own political agenda. Over time, his influence within the radical wing began to grow, leading to him becoming its de facto leader.

His father used his contacts and power to guarantee young Ömer would get the best education available in the Empire, at the Galatasaray Lycée, Turkey's oldest high school. When he was 11 years old, it was decided that he should attend a European school instead, and, as such, the young prince was sent to the Theresianum Military Academy in Vienna, where he not only learned valuable lessons about military strategies, but also about carpentry, masonry, and other manual skills. After spending a few years in Vienna, he was transferred to the Prussian Military Academy in Potsdam, where he received a more disciplined training.\n\nNot long after he graduated from the academy in 1914, the Weltkrieg broke out. During the first stages of the war, Ömer fought for the Germans, first in Galicia and later on also in Verdun. For his bravery in battle, he was awarded a golden cigarette case, the Red Eagle medal, and the Iron Cross of the First Degree, together with a signed photograph of the Kaiser himself. However, as the Weltkrieg was nearing its end, Ömer was recalled to the Ottoman Empire, for which he fought for the remainder of the conflict.\n\nAfterwards, he remained a relatively important figure in the Ottoman military, chaired the football club Fenerbahçe S.K., and befriended ex-CUP members such as Refet Bele. His relatively peaceful life was disrupted by the outbreak of the Levant Crisis, during which he once again fought in the name of the Empire. Even so, the war did not end well for the Ottoman state - and for Ömer, the incapable government was to blame. With the blessing of his allies in the OSP, he was able to enforce his claim to the throne, and now that he rules over the Empire, he seeks to succeed where the Sultans before him had failed and to bring glory to the downhearted nation.§!"

In the following years, Refet joined the Committee of Union and Progress, served in the Ottoman Gendarmerie, and fought in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars. With his competence and skill proven on the field of battle, he quickly began to climb the military ladder, making it to the rank of major by 1913.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Paşa commanded part of the Ottoman forces on the Palestinian front, where he managed to hold his line until the Ottoman defences were shattered by Allenby's advance in late 1918. Allegedly, the collapse of the Ottoman frontline also saw Refet get cut off from the retreating forces, forcing him to sneak his way across dozens of kilometres of enemy territory on his own.\n\nWith the end of the Weltkrieg, Refet Paşa had become a famed and greatly decorated military officer. When Kemal claimed chairmanship of the former CUP in 1925, he was among the first to leave the party, since the Gazi's radically secularist notions directly contradicted with Refet's deep-rooted respect for the Sultan and the Caliphate. Staying mostly out of politics thereafter, the Paşa continued his service in the military, and, as such, took part in the defence of the Empire during the Levant Crisis. His efforts proved futile, however, and with the Empire in shambles, Refet felt the need to act.

In spite of taking much from the old Bolshevik political platform, there was a key difference nonetheless: A reassessment of the importance of the Ukrainian National Question. Although the UKP agreed to solidify this \"nationally-minded\" course through a comfortable majority, there was still the question of the UKP's overall goal. Should it seek to join Ukrainian Revolutionary Structures and forgo any ties to the possible Revolution in Russia or continue to try and fraternise with the Russian Revolutionary Movement, naturally weakening the ties to the Ukrainian one? As such, multiple fractions emerged. In the end, the overall leadership of the party went to Vlas Chubar, who represented a tenuous internal compromise and was seen as a leader capable of starting a new chapter in the history of the revolutionary movement.

 ukraine.92.d:9 "Stories of the miraculous and holy abound across the Ukrainian steppe. In the province of Luhanske, one can find a woods preacher in every town, extolling the virtues of natural living. These men usually retire in the winter, leaving streets quiet on the Holy Week. But this holy week is different.\n\nOn a bitter night, in -45c weather, a group of men and women are outside Luhansk. Reports from the police are called out to arrest them. What they find when they are pulled indoors is a shock. Men and women, mostly topless, without shoes. Their leader, a squat man with a long white beard.\n\nThe first report, that the police had captured Father Christmas, was dismissed as a holiday prank. However, the local authorities are asking us how to pay for their holding after the new year. These are real people, and they claim to be followers of Profiny Ivonov. They are not Christians nor are they Old Believers. Their leader has a history of registry with the Communist Party of Russia, and yet he is a preacher. These members apparently believe, erroneously, that the subzero weather outside will cure them of all ailments.\n\nObviously mad, but maybe there is an alternative theory? These madmen, by their continued existence, actually help the finances of the Ukrainian government. They refuse all welfare, refuse medical care, refuse meat and all charity. If this group is allowed to propagate in our country, they could save the government thousands in welfare. Obviously this would result in the deaths of many followers, for their healthcare is a fiction and their heterodoxy is barely tolerated by the city of Luhanske."
 ukraine_revolt.20.d:9 "[192.GetName], the second largest city in Ukraine, had already been paralysed by dockworkers' strikes for weeks. The strikers had erected barricades to central roads and the Borotbyst-organised guards had essentially fortified the port of [192.GetName], and were in tense negotiations with the city officials loyal to [202.GetName].\n\nWhen the news of open rebellion in the north arrived to the city, all hell broke loose. The Borotbysts wanted immediate revolution and total seizure of the city; their more moderate allies still believed that the Hetman would give up to the pressure. This changed when a mutiny broke out onboard of the destroyer Berestya, which promptly opened fire on army checkpoints erected around the harbour. Only hours later the Borotbysts had seized control of much of the city's infrastructure, such as the radio station and the northern routes into the city. The Workers' Commune of [192.GetName] was declared by the local leader of the uprising, Oleksandr Khmelnytskyi, in a grey area between not being officially aligned to VDR, but fighting against the Hetman's forces regardless."
 ukraine_negotiations.14.d:9 "The compromise was enough for the VDR. In-person negotiations were agreed upon, to be held in the small crossroads town of Kalynivka near [198.GetName]. The mood was tense as Hetmanych Danylo Skoropadskyi and Otaman-Minister Doroshenko arrived there with a group of Soim representatives and a relatively small police detachment. The VDR was represented by committee led by Symon Petliura personally, alongside socialist leader Nykyfir Hryhoriiv. They also had a security detail of soldiers, though both sides agreed to restrict their security forces into separate parts of the town, and away from the negotiation building.\n\nThe initial talks agreed on principles of the negotiations, local cease-fire and mutual de-escalation for now. However, to truly de-escalate the situation, the VDR needs proper concessions: promises that will satisfy their enraged base.The first promise the government made was continuation of the land reform, which has been among the main demands for VDR's peasant organisations and militias. Reassurances were demanded to make sure that the reform will actually include adequate land redistribution, instead of mere promise of it.\n\nLuckily, both Danylo and Doroshenko seem to agree on this. While the Otaman-Minister's promises are easily taken back by politicking, the Hetman's heir apparent's official signature on land reform demand should be strong enough assurance, as it puts the prestige of the Hetmanate on the line."
 ukraine_borotbist.12.d:9 "As if it wasn't already bad enough, the ailing situation in the urban areas has now seen the creation of the Red Guards — revived revolutionary groups from the 1936 uprising. Organised for the purpose of worker self-defence, especially in the Donbas and Krvybas, they are in fact lacking a Borotbyst connection. Nonetheless, the unity between the peasants and industrial workers is increasing, forming a very dangerous opposition force to the republic."
 ukraine_borotbist.13.d:9 "The formation of the Red Guards has gone about as expected. Clashes immediately began between them and the People's Militsya supported by volunteers defending the republic. Sending the army in would likely be disastrous and only inflame the protests, but a decision must be made for what to do with the degree of involvement of the People's Militsya. Reigning them in may be seen as an act of goodwill, but some have said that the show of force is necessary if we are to preserve the republic."
 ukraine_borotbist.15.d:9 "With widespread revolutionary guards flexing their muscles and republic's law enforcement careful in their actions, we have once more fallen into the chaos akin to that before the Anti-Hetman Revolt. Since the previous clashes between the People's Militsya and protestors only added fuel to the fire, now the government is trying to avoid escalation and any actions that could be constructed as similar to those of Skoropadskyi some years ago, but it hardly seems to be better option. Crime has surged as Borotbysts have essentially took over entire districts in some places."
 ukraine_borotbist.18.d:9 "The general strike that was rumoured has finally began. All across the republic, steel workers, railway workers, and miners have refused to work and have called for better working conditions and the resignation of the current government, allowing the formation of a socialist republic. Propaganda of 1936 has been redirected at the republic, accusing the government of merely becoming new Hetmanate equally uncaring of the common man's plight. The whole nation has been ground to a halt - even some in the People's Militsya have defected to the Borotbysts, while [UKR.GetLeader]'s government has hotly debated what to do in response."
 ukraine_borotbist.77.d:9 "With the advent of the Borotbyst Revolution, the country has found itself surrounded on all sides, far from its Third Internationale allies. There are rumours that the Reichspakt or Russia is planning an offensive to take [202.GetName] given its proximity to the frontlines. With the country partially occupied, the Borotbyst leadership is discussing what is to be done about the former Hetman, Pavlo Petrovych Skoropadskyi, rotting in Lukianivska Prison in western [202.GetName] ever since the successful revolt against him.\n\nIf [202.GetName] were to fall, Skoropadskyi could be captured and reinstated as a puppet leader for the Russians or Germans. It would be a crushing blow to our righteous cause, for it would risk the outright collapse of the troops' already wavering morale. To the workers of the revolution, it would cause consternation that simply ought to be averted.\n\nWith the Hetman question being the talk of the day in [202.GetName], after the Chervonyi Papor newspaper spread rumours about it from an undisclosed source, it has reached the ranks of the Lukianivska prison guard. Constituted of primarily fanatical and benighted folk, to them the very sight of the Hetman everyday has grown repulsive with time. Now a frail old man, his days are numbered as he awaits to see how his life will end; his body stiff and immobile for all he has gotten is bits of bread to eat.\n\nIn the evening of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], with the order of an officer, he was dragged by two subalterns out of his cell, limping on his way out to the yard. Tied upright to a wooden pole and his eyes blindfolded, the Hetman uttered his final words. The officer proceeded to announce all the charges against him in a sort of improvised trial speaking vehemently as if preaching to vanquish the devil.\nWith a twilight on the horizon, a soldier shot the man with his rifle. Just like the colour of the sky late that night, this affair was classified."
 ukraine_republican.124.d:9 "The new Council of Ministers approved by the Zbory has signalled the return of one of the R-RB's most promising individuals: Anatolii Pisotskyi. Best known as a Marxist doctrinaire and uncompromising individual, Pisotskyi now wields one of the most powerful positions in the government.\n\nImmediately, he embarked on a radical reorganisation of the Interior Ministry - those with ties to the Hetmanist government and plenty in Petliura's provisional administration were dismissed, and those with close ties to Pisotskyi have reached high-ranking posts, mostly hardliner veterans from the Anti-Hetman Revolt and fellow party members.\n\nAdditionally, citing the possibility of 'anti-republican activity' after the election, Pisotskyi has also issued an expansion of the People's Militsya. Generally, the People's Militsya has far more socialist leanings than the army, and many of their best fighters experienced the worst of the Hetman's regime, which has been a key factor in their ideological development as a force strongly associated with the Workers' Democratic Union.\n\nWhile those truly dedicated to the revolution recognise many of his acts as necessary, it hasn't been long since the inauguration of the people's rule. Too radical action too quickly may convince Germany to get second thoughts - or emphasise the disunity between our coalition as a whole."
 ukraine_republican.131.d:9 "Organising the People's Militsya was not going to be easy, and time was running out. In the first few hours of the so-called 'Second Revolt', under the orders of Pisotskyi the People's Militsya gathered arms and prepared for a decisive battle against the [202.GetName] Garrison. Few truly understood what they were fighting for, and abandoned their attempt to dislodge the Army almost as soon as the order was given.\n\nAs the People's Militsya approached the garrison and the order was given to fire, shots were exchanged, but the affair did not last long. Unable to shoot their countrymen, many of them who also fought in the Anti-Hetman Revolt and were comrades then, the great 'March on [202.GetName]' lasted no longer than twelve hours at most.\n\nAs the Army began the disarmament of the People's Militsya, an arrest warrant was made for Pisotskyi and his allies in the Ministry of the Interior. Meanwhile, Vynnychenko was in tense negotiations with the USDRP. He sincerely argued that he had done everything in his power to save the frailing coalition, but continued to be criticised for his lack of rebuttal to Pisotskyi earlier, which only gave him another reason to execute this lawless coup. Still, they came to a deal: in exchange for Vynnychenko's resignation as Chairman, he would be able to avoid any investigations into the affair.\n\nInterim Chairman Khrystiuk's tenure lasted only a day. In a vote of no confidence, with the UPS-R's moderate faction and the USDRP voting almost unanimously, Isaak Mazepa was inaugurated as the country's new Chairman.\n\nMazepa's promises to heal recently opened wounds in the National Zbory received some fanfare, but ultimately, it could be best said that the whole messy affair has sown great seeds of doubt in the legitimacy of the People's Republic. What may exist now may be more sustainable than the Hetman's government, but will faith in democracy be restored after such an incident?"
 ukraine_republican.184.d:9 "Our decision to support the USDRP initiative regarding the proper ideological and educational development of the armed forces has unsurprisingly drawn a lot of criticism. While the loud outcries of the general Bolbochan and the quiet grumbles of general Omelianovych-Pavlenko were to be expected, dissatisfaction is noticeable even among more reserved high-ranking officers.\n\nGenerals Hrekiv and Сhyzhevskyi are rare examples of the members of the military brass sympathetic to our party, particularly to its right wing. This affiliation is rooted in their connections to the parties of Socialists-Independists and People's Republicans, many of whom joined the URDP in 1920s and now constitute its right faction. Now these officers privately contacted the party in order to voice their concerns regarding the reforms in the army. The crux of their argument boils down to the simple notion: excessive politicisation of the army is harmful, no matter who conducts it, a hetmanist or a democrat.\n\nWhile we reject the accusations of 'excessive politicisation' and maintain that the long-term benefits of the reform will outweigh short-term disruptions caused by it, some among the party call to at least acknowledge the genuine concerns of our allies among the military. Others are more sceptical and see in this message merely a veiled plea to the party, an appeal to use its influence in order to safeguard the positions of two generals and their associates — rather rich, coming from the people bemoaning the alleged 'politicisation' of the army."

 XSM_country_intro_content:9 "The §PMa Clique§! is comprised of a multitude of a §lChinese§! governors who have been serving the §cQing Dynasty§! ever since the 1880s. The §PMa family§! itself is not one giant family, but three that have divided power in the ruling area. The §Pfirst family§! has been overshadowed after the family head, §PMa Anliang§! died in 1918. Now primarily led by the §Psecond§! and §Pthird families§!, the §Pclique§! has had a prosperous reign over its territory since.\n\nThe §lXinhai Revolution§! led to the §PMas§! under §PAnliang§! to initially side with the §cQing§!, but when defeat was inevitable, defecting to the §lrepublic§!. Afterwards forcing both the §PMongols§! to the north and §PTibet§! to the south to recognise the §lRepublic§! as the legitimate government, the §PMas§! kept an air of stability inside Northwest China. §PMa Anliang§! soon died in 1918, with the §Pclique§! being primarily divided in two. The §PMa Clique§! under §PMa Fuxiang§! holding §PGansu§! and §PNingxia§! and the §csouthern Clique§! under §cMa Qi§! based in soon to be §cQinghai§!.\n\nThe §Pclique§! was still somewhat united in who they sided with however, with the §gGuominjun§! soon occupying §Psouthern Gansu§!, forcing the §PMas§! to side with §gFeng Yuxiang§!. After the reality of the §gGuominjun's§! condition became more clear, all the §Pwarlords§! except for a small few defected from their side over to the §PZhili§!.\n\nStaying loyal to the §PZhili§! through the §cQing restoration§! and beyond, the §PMas§! have become trusted figures by most if not all cliques as valid protectors of the northwest intent to keep the land §lChinese§!. Now also ruling over §gSuiyuan§!, known also as §gUlanqab§! by the §PMongols§!, the §Pclique§! prospers as vital members of the §cQing Dynasty§!, ready to fight for what they believe in."

Following the failure of the Northern Expedition and the decline of Chinese socialism, the remaining revolutionary loyalists in their special branch established contact with the KMT's new information agency.§!\n"

Many have gone underground to support extremist movements, split off to form new political groups or made the pragmatic choice to distance themselves from the party's radical leftward turn. The few men in Yunnan who still openly support the Kuomintang are a moribund clique with little to no actual influence over provincial politics, which is likely the only reason they've been tolerated by the conservative warlords.§!\n"

Now reduced to a shell of its former self, exiled to Yunnan and adopted an older and less proactive name, the National Foundation Army, the NRA remnant remains cautious of both Tang Jiyao's stern, Federalist government, as well as the new socialist direction that the KMT has embraced. The repeated conflicts between Tang's beliefs, versus the NFA's own radical republicanism have prevented the NFA from ever being properly integrated into Yunnan's military, leaving them dangerously autonomous, loyal only in name to the man who once granted them refuge.§!\n"
 YUN_market_liberal_party_long:9 "Southwest Industrial Group (Xi'nan Shiyexi)\n§gYunnan Province may be regarded by the rest of China as primitive and backwater, but despite its underdeveloped nature it has been a prime spot of investment for industrialists and bankers. War requires money, and plenty of profits have been made on the backs of Tang Jiyao's wild ambitions. The Southwest Industrial Group are a clique of businessmen who collaborate with Tang's regime, but they're quite flexible, and would gladly be willing to lend their funding and their properties to a higher bidder or more powerful warlord...§!\n"
 YUN_social_conservative_party_long:9 "National Foundation Army (Jian Guo Dian Jun), the remnants of the National Revolutionary Army\n§gThe NRA may be ostensibly pledged to upholding the ideals of nationalism, democracy and justice, but desperate times have called for desperate measures. Sometimes the Three Principles of the People must be temporarily suspended to protect the revolution. Thankfully for the progressives, the death of Chiang Kai-shek and the disgrace of many key military figures within the Kuomintang has largely discredited this cynical way of thought.§!\n"
 YUN_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:9 "Public Interest Party\n§gThe Zhongguo Zhigongdang, or China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party of China) is the main political party of the Federalist movement in China. Founded in 1925 by Chen Jiongming and Tang Jiyao, the party united disillusioned Kuomintang politicians and Overseas Chinese (especially Freemasons of the Hongmen), calling for the reform of the Republic of China into a proper federal state and multiparty democracy. While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism. Their platform, outside of federalism and republican democracy, espouses progressive social and political views from land and education reform to elected assemblies for all government levels.§!\n"
 YUN_paternal_autocrat_party_long:9 "Army of National Pacification (Jing Guo Dian Jun)\n§gTang Jiyao has ruled Yunnan for decades, maintaining a steadfast bastion of Republican revolutionaries in spite of the monarchy's restoration. In some ways, his diligence and his ambitious nature is quite respectable. His officer corps is loyal to him, even if they sometimes aspire for higher stations. Yet as the balance of power in China continues to change, it remains to be seen if Tang Jiyao can change with it, or if he will be smothered by the tides of history, the last of Cai E.§!\n"
 YUN_national_populist_party_long:9 "Minority Nationalists\n§gYunnan Province is home to dozens of ethnic groups and religious beliefs, its frontiers have long been an untamed, rebellious backwater that the Kunming administration has struggled to suppress. The various tribes, chieftains and religious sects have long felt that their ways of life were under attack from China's Han and Manchu elites. With the legacy of great wars like the Panthay Rebellion still looming over the province, it would not take much to provoke the tribes to take action, especially if they sense a moment of weakness from Kunming.§!\n"
 YUN_Long_Yun_takes_over_party_long:9 "Army of National Pacification (Jing Guo Dian Jun)\n§gLong Yun emerged as the only man capable of quelling the falling out between the various factions of the Army of National Pacification. Even if it meant having to turn on his own brother, he undertook the necessary measures to entrench his administration in Kunming and hold the city. Now that the dust has settled after this period of brief civil war, it remains to be seen if this young, ambitious Yi General has what it takes to rebuild Yunnan. Long Yun had often dreamed of one day surpassing Tang Jiyao, and now he finally has a chance to do just so.§!\n"
 YUN_Lu_Han_takes_over_party_long:9 "Army of National Pacification (Jing Guo Dian Jun)\n§gThe rebels would never say their ambitions over Tang's office were out of jealousy, but rather due to a strong belief that the Yunnan Clique was going down a dangerous path and needed a new leader to save it. Despite this, it's been an open secret the officer corps has feuded with Tang for over a decade. Neither side had previously dared to openly attack the other, but it seems the recent disaster of a military venture finally provoked them to strike first.§!\n"
