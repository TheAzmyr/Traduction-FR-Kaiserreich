 chinese_unification_desc:9 "Central authority in China has long eroded, as decades of foreign imperialism, political instability and domestic unrest in light of imperial weakness spawned a new class of regional militarists in the ailing days of the old Qing Empire. The Xinhai Revolution brought further turmoil to the nation, as revolutionary generals seized control of numerous provinces and set about building complex networks of military officers, allied businessmen, landed gentry, sympathetic intelligentsia, and government officials.\n\nNevertheless, a common national identity remains, and various movements across the land have made their bid to unite the nation and rebuild China in their image. Taking advantage of their own patronage networks, foreign support, and growing armies, they clash for influence in the cities and countryside. Still, in the twisting and turning realities of warlord China, open warfare is not the only this conflict develops. Tales of shifting alliances and sordid betrayal unfold, all the while foreign invasion looms...\n\n§COur leadership is currently [ChinaGetMemberAlignment] §YAligned§!.§!"

This offers us a unique opportunity - if we were to go to war with Japan and strike against their imperialist projects in Dongbei, our prestige would be cemented and we would be elevated as national heroes. The rest of China would likely be force to fall in line as part of a United Front against Japanese aggression, and in embroiling the Japanese in both a land and sea war at the same time, we will overstretch them until they fall!"

[ROOT.GetLeader] has delivered a speech today in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] formally announcing the creation a Chinese United Front, and calling for all China to rally to the national cause.\n\nThe war ahead is not expected to be easy by any means, and the coalition we assembled will likely be unwieldy. Nonetheless, our strength has been buttressed by the joint might of various warlord armies, and our odds considerably improved as a result. Under the shadow of war, China girds itself for a prolonged conflict against those who would subjugate it."

Unwilling to risk bloodshed and their potential destruction, they have agreed to an unconditional surrender on our terms. After we decided to respect civilian governments and civilians in the lost territories, their government officially surrendered and accepted the Chinese annexation of their lands in a peaceful transfer of power. Throughout our nation, our citizens shall celebrate as the country, long divided, will unite once more."
 china_events.102.d:9 "Faced against overwhelming political and military odds, [FROM.GetNameDef] has seen to reason and has agreed to attend negotiations. Unwilling to risk bloodshed and their potential destruction but still maintaining a sense of dignity and independence, they have offered us their surrender in return for autonomy. They will be allowed to operate de jure outside our country as a sovereign entity but will be tied exclusively to our markets and political alignments. While we certainly view these lands as integral to the Chinese nation, perhaps we can see their point and respect their autonomy under our influence. Other nationalists have argued that since we have the larger hand in these negotiations, we should at least demand the regions with the most Han inhabitants so that we can encourage settlement on the frontiers. Alternatively, the warhawks in our government have simply demanded that we go to war right away as [FROM.GetNameDef] has little chance against our military might."

Only time will tell whether or not China will catch up to the rest of the world, but for now, the Chinese people can finally rest, knowing that the chaotic Warlord Period has come to an end."

 ACC_harry_cain_leader_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 10th, 1906, in Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHarry Pulliam Cain was born with his twin brother to a family with a strong Southern heritage, something they made sure that Cain remembered well and took pride in even after they moved to Tacoma, Washington in 1911. Despite losing his mother at age 11 and developing a case of Bell's palsy that temporarily restrained his ability to speak, he overcame both and enrolled in Hill Military Academy and later The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, developing an affinity for the 18th-century Anglo-Irish conservative philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke. His studies also drew him towards the field of journalism, which led to him taking a job offer for The New York Times after graduating in 1929.\n\nCain's life, like the rest of America's, was completely upended by the news of MacArthur's coup and the following Californian revolt. Finding MacArthur's actions to be a sick perversion of conservativism, Cain quickly joined up with the fledgling Pacific army, where his previous military schooling was a welcome asset and helped him find a talent for military government, a skill in great demand when dealing with the unprecedented humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war. Following his service, he returned to Tacoma to run for its largely nonpartisan mayoral office, winning the election handily by virtue of his war record and public campaign style. After a largely successful term, the conservative Democrat, long falling out of love with the party, changed his registration to Republican and made a run for the Senate, creating his first brush with controversy by accusing his Democratic opponent of having ties to Socialist front organisations. It would not be his last - the senator rapidly became notorious for his inflammatory conservative stances throughout his term.\n\nCain's rails against the tripartite threat of Socialism, Longism, and MacArthurism carried him to the Republican nomination and the presidency - but now that he's privy to the inner workings of the ongoing committees dedicated to investigating \"subversive activities\", Cain has shocked everyone by coming out against many of the procedures as violations of civil liberties and due process of law. President Cain is quickly earning a reputation as a man at odds with his past - and a man prepared to make a stand for any opinion, no matter how controversial.§!"

Born in an impoverished family, Cao left his hometown as a teen and joined the late Qing army to secure a living like many ordinary people did. After serving for some years in the 4th Zhen (Division) of the Qing Army under Li Houji, Cao was enrolled in the academy of the unit and later became a junior officer.\n\nSpending about two decades in this unit despite the collapse of the Qing empire and the formation of the Republic, Cao, who rose from a platoon commander to a regiment commander, would be a brigade commander with the rank of major general in 1924 when Sun Chuanfang declared himself the League Marshal and reorganised armies of multiple provinces in Eastern China. Cao continued to be a commander of the Fujian Army under Sun Chuanfang and aided him against the KMT during and after the Northern Expedition.\n\nAs Sun Chuanfang's League completely collapsed in the League War, Cao's career seemed to come to an end. However, he reorganised his remaining units in Fujian and decided to try his luck with Chen Tiaoyuan's Anhui forces. With the idea of uniting all possible strength against imperialists, Chen took now this experienced officer and Cao's field experience would undoubtedly contribute to Chen's cause.\n\n§YNotes: As an easy-going officer who reads the room he is in well, Cao Wanshun shrewdly refrained from involving in any kind of political affairs and workplace politics, ensuring that he would never make enemies and rivals in the ranks under Chen Tiaoyuan.§!"

He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nWith the recent pass of the Roque Sáenz Peña Law in 1912, Repetto won his seat as national deputy with 48.778 votes for him at the City of Buenos Aires. He officially was national deputy on July 21st, 1913. There, he supported assistance to family farms and worked to expose abusive labour conditions on plantations throughout the north of the country.\n\nDue to the events of the Patagonian Rebellion between 1920-1922, Repetto went on a fishing vessel alongside other syndicalist and communist leaders to Puerto Madryn, the capital of the new Patagonian state which had seceded from Argentina. He is still part of the Partido Socialista, an alternate name to the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina (FORA), one of the three main factions in the FOP\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow.§!"

They are also joined by RCA politicians and intellectuals who have long links with Shanxi's revolutionary cadre and will no doubt seek to continue on the legacy of Dr. Sun in Shaanxi Province.

Not simply defeating old tyrants and replacing them, but building an entirely new system. Sadly however, progress requires breaking a few omelets, and it's not always as easy as chasing out old reactionaries.\n\nWhen magistrates (often affiliated with the RCA) were deployed in areas just outside of Nanjing to to help reorganise freshly created cooperatives and sort out disputes, many reported being intimidated or even fired upon by local militias. Worryingly, many were previously armed by the NRA and report fears that central government magistrates have come to take their land.\n\nIt wasn't long before accusations of treason began to fly. Angry hearings have charged PAC affiliated officers of deliberately stoking peasant fears to sabotage the RCA's efforts at land reform, exploiting their dominance of recently installed local rural leadership councils to undermine the party. The PAC have countered with sordid peasant testimonies of brutality and corruption by party commissars, though it appears too late: once the wheels of party machinery have started there is little stopping it.\n\nMany militias have been ordered to disarm or at least stand down, and Deng Yanda's reputation cut down to size.

While the [CHI.GetNameDef] now controls the former imperial capital of Beijing, strengthening its legitimacy as a national unifier; there is still much work to do to win the people's hearts and minds and drive the Japanese imperialists out of China once and forever.\n\nThe Congress has also seen greater participation of revolutionary women within the ranks of the Kuomintang. Most notable are those such as Deng Yingchao, Zeng Xing, Cai Chang, and Xiang Jingyu (who all hold long ties with the Chinese socialist movement) but also newcomers such as the wife of the Uygur politician Burhan Shadidi and the deputy director of Xinjiang Women's Federation - Rashida. Furthermore, in attendance are members of the Internationale Military Mission in China, yet another reminder of the Internationale's staunch support for the success of the socialist Chinese Revolution. And without further ado, Wang's concluding remarks on the importance of unity drew only polite applause as the Congress delegates began to take the floor."

 CHI.lategame.291.d:9 "Word has reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that the Kuomintang has been torn apart by their divisions over Wang Jingwei's Chairmanship, in part due to his handling of the Kuomintang-Federalist alliance. After a failed attempt to impeach him, dissident forces led by the Kuomintang's military hardliners have organised a rebellion from their old Jiangxi-Fujian strongholds. Opposition figures led by Song Qingling have gathered in Wuhan hoping to overthrow Wang, but it seems like their moment has passed.\n\nWang's situation is still precarious however, and he has sought to stabilise his position by reaching out to us. Ever the artful politician, he has sought to spin the situation as a positive - \"proof\" in his words that the majority of the party are willing to set aside our past differences. He argues that the Kuomintang have held up their end of the bargain thusfar, and it is now time for us to accept the integration of our movement. The elimination of his political rivals now smoothen the way for a lasting political accord.\n\nWang has been blessed with a silver tongue, but the sincerity of his offer is questionable. The Kuomintang does seem to be willing to engage in limited democratisation for the duration of their \"political tutelage\", and Wang has expressed some sinecere amenability to Federalist principles. However, if we agree to lay down our arms as the Kuomintang finish tearing each other apart there is no going back - if we would like to topple the party-state now is the time to do it."

In a coordinated fashion and with ruthless speed, his forces have turned on us - advancing quickly in hopes of destroying us at our weakest moment. To add insult to injury, he has attempted to legitimise his coup against us by declaring us to be tyrants in the making, slandering us with all sorts of lies about our supposed broken promises. If our revolution is to survive, the [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] rebellion must be put down and put down quickly. It remains to be seen how many more will join him in his treason."
 CHI.endgame.403.d:9 "Not wanting a repeat of earlier violence, President Song has placed pressure on negotiators to come up up with a favourable resolution to the crisis. She has also ordered the military to show restraint, though the army has yet to be ordered to return to their barracks. The old Provisional Action Committee still dominates the centre of Kuomintang political discourse, preventing any easy unification between Sun Fo's rightists and the various leftist opposition groups arrayed against her.\n\nStill, matters remain unsettled within the Kuomintang. The RCA has officially been disbanded, though unofficially a rump caucus remains. Left only with Gu Mengyu and his moderates, they have been on the backfoot, their future uncertain now that many of their old peers have been arrested or exiled. Seeking the vulnerability of Song's Revolutionary Committee, they have pressed for greater amnesty for the defeated and compromises with the public. They have been joined by many former PAC members who have called on Song and Deng to take decisive action to alleviate tensions and promote dialogue.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many hardliners who point out that continuing to recklessly compromise with everyone will simply render the party unable to statisfy anyone. They have taken the form of extremists within the party, mostly CRS-aligned officers but plenty of WMARCA members have expressed these sentiments in private. This is not to say of course that many soldiers want further fighting - many officers have gone on record opposing a crackdown and many of the enlisted wish to go home soon."
 CHI.endgame.450.d:9 "The newly reunified Republic of China uses the National Flag, which features the Blue Sky and White Sun of the Kuomintang's Party Flag as well as the Wholly Red Earth.However, there have been proposals since the recently held People's Congress to honour the peasants who have built this country as well as to pay homage to the Peasant Training Institute of the Provisional Action Committee. Former PAC members and syndicalists have proposed to the Legislative Yuan of the Party to adopt a new national flag, one that brings honour to the peasants with a characterstic plow added to the Wholly Red Earth. There have been others however, who have proposed that the new Flag of the Republic should incorporate elements for both the workers and peasants. Indeed as the PAC had championed the cause for all oppressed peoples, the new flag should depict the workers and the peasants by incorporating the plow and a symbol of a cog together. Of course, there is always the option to just merely maintain the current Flag of the Republic as a demonstration of our commitment to the original ideals held by Dr. Sun's revolution."
 CHI.endgame.805.d:9 "After a long struggle with alcohol, Chairman Zeng Zhongming has decided to fully commit himself to sobriety. The first few weeks... no, the first few days were hell on earth. From hand shakes to headaches, the Chairman often had to excuse himself from meetings with members of the Central Committee, much to the smug satisifcation of those in the RCA such as Shi Cuntong and Chen Gongbo. Nonetheless, with his sister Zeng Xing by his side, the Chairman has forsaken drinking and has taken it upon to himself, to focus on French and Chinese literature in his freetime.\n\nNow, with significant government reforms underway and his confidence restored, the Zeng of today is not the Zeng of yesterday. There are few rumours suggesting to overthrow the young Chairman, as the Chairman now finds himself confident enough to host long meetings and make public addresses.

While hardly one of the dominant parties in the 1920s, the KF succesfully used its entrenchment in the upper house to block Stauning's more radical policies. One of its core tenets is to stand against the spread of socialism, a position the party has hardened since the British Revolution.\n\nConservative leader John Christmas Møller had long been detracting support from Stauning through labour reforms and activism for workers' rights, but many are growing wary of his counciliatory measures. Though this 'red scare' has inspired a resurgence of conservatism in Danish society, the KF is currently far from the levers of power, and even its one-time partner Venstre does not see eye-to-eye with its policy of rearmament 'to take the fight abroad', and so the KF sees itself alone in campaigning against Peter Munch's antimilitarist rhetoric and advocating for the necessary militarisation and investment into the army.§!\n"

Content with keeping the SPD and the DVLP away from the Chancellorship, Wilhelm II endorsed this consensus, approving their Chancellors and offering cooperative ones elsewhere.\n\nThis consensus has come to an end. Decline of the Liberale Volkspartei, the arrogant and toady attitude of Chancellor Herbert von Dirksen, and growth of Reichstag's \"Permanent Opposition\" have all contributed to its death. In mid 1935, the March Coalition dissolved, and the Chancellor now has almost no support in the Reichstag. Defying expectations, the SPD and DVLP refused to call for a vote of no confidence against the Chancellor, intending to leave him rot in the skeletal throne until the elections to the Reichstag this April.

Even this victory did not make the brilliant minds of the Deutsches Heer rest - new weapons and techniques of war such as armoured vehicles and combined arms have been adapted to the traditional doctrine of mobile warfare, and the Luftstreitkräfte was established as an independent air force after a pitched political brawl in 1927.\n\nAs invincible as the German army seems, however, it suffers as an institution. The laurels of victory hide lacking central coordination, dominance of the military by aristocrats and vitriolic interservice rivalry. The Heer has become divided into cliques, each with their own way to resolve the crisis, while motivation to reform the military among the civilian government is at an all time low - but if Germany is to win the inevitable Second Weltkrieg, these problems must be resolved."

Educated by Cai E, he quickly rose through the ranks under the Guangxi Clique and he would personally rise to prominence through Yunnan's invasion of Guangxi in 1923. Gathering a significant force as Yunnan retreated, he aligned himself with the KMT forces and established the New Guangxi Clique after evicting the Old Clique from the province.\nDuring the Northern Expedition, Li's skilled leadership of the Nationalist Seventh Army earned it the moniker of \"Army of Steel\", being one of the few NRA commanders to have defeated Wu Peifu on the field.

 HAI_country_intro_content:9 "President Calixte and the elite of the Garde d'Haiti paraded through Port-au-Prince to celebrate Haitian Independence Day, a day which seems ironic to many considering Haiti's political situation. Haiti was occupied by the United States starting in 1919, and while the occupation officially ended in 1933, American restrictions are still severe.\n\nFollowing President Calixte's coup of former President Louis Borno in 1933, the Haitian-American relationship has become even more strained. With the establishment puppet Borno no longer around to do the bidding of American banks, they have struggled to get President Calixte to follow the agreements made by previous Haitian governments regarding Haiti's finances. As with anything in Haiti, race plays a major role. Calixte is loved by the poorer black population, including its most proud institution, the army. The mixed-race political elite detests Calixte and wishes to regain control of the political apparatus.\n\nWith the Haitian general elections on the horizon in April, Calixte will struggle to secure the support of the National Assembly to earn re-election, and struggle harder to secure support in the Council of State for ratification. Calixte has been presented with 3 options by his cabinet and clique of advisors. First, attempt to use proscribed methods to gain the support of Deputies and Councillors. Second, run a popular campaign and give up the title of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti as a gesture of good faith. Third, the most radical option, is to do anything within his power to prevent the ratification of a Lescot victory and appoint himself to his own cabinet, thereby continuing to rule by de facto authority even after his term has elapsed.\n\nOpposition leader Elie Lescot, who is supported by a broad coalition including the nationalist Sténio Vincent and liberal Jean Price-Mars, has made it clear that if Calixte loses legitimately and refuses to hand over power, he will resort to violence to protect democracy in Haiti."

Price-Mars is a champion of Négritude, the belief in a shared \"black\" consciousness among the African diaspora, and a prominent advocate of voodoo as a complete religion.\n\nHis political ideology stems heavily from the resistance of Haitian peasants towards the American occupation, and he heavily despises the Haitian elite for their seeming ineptitude to provide for the masses.

 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text:9 "Sinn Féin\n§LSinn Féin, meaning \"Ourselves\", have undoubtedly been the pre-eminent party in Ireland since the mid-1910s. The oldest party in the state, they were founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, originally promoting a Dual Monarchy between Great Britain and Ireland akin to Austria-Hungary, proposing that Irish MPs abstain from Westminster and instead meet in Dublin. Although they remained abstentionist, this policy radically shifted to republicanism following the party being erroneously credited with the Easter Rising of 1916. Griffith remained working with the party, handed over party leadership to surviving 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, and the party steamrolled into power in the 1918 Home Rule Election, foregoing any British authority and instead forming Dáil Éireann in Dublin.\n\nAfter the small split in the party following the War of Independence and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, it has been the current party's vision that has moulded the young republic. Seen as the party of the Irish middle class, they have formed the pillars of Law, Order, Religious Pluralism and International Trade. While being just to the right of centre on political and economic matters, Sinn Féin are considered to be socially liberal and somewhat cosmopolitan in the Irish context."

As an outstanding student, together with celebrities like Yan Xishan, Tang Jiyao, Zhao Hengti and most importantly, Sun Chuanfang, he was sent to the 6th Class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where Li studied infantry. After returning to China in 1909, this brilliant officer was recruited into the Imperial Guard, as Li's talent was recognised by Zaitao, he became one of the few Han people who held a senior position in the Qing Imperial Guards.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out, leaving a sorry letter to Zaitao, Li Erkang joined the revolutionary army as a tutor and stayed in his home province afterwards, serving as a military writer, staff and tutor in the governorate of Zhejiang. After Sun Chuanfang marched into Zhejiang, Li was hired by Sun and was sent to Japan in 1923-1924. After his return, he spent most time concluding and publishing his observations on the most dangerous enemy of China and aiding Sun Chuanfang in training new officers. Although Li disagrees with the concessionist nature of the League, he stays for the considerable publishing resources in Zhejiang and ideal environment for military academic discussion and exchange with the powers, particularly with Germany, which Li regards as the most militarily advanced power.\n\n§YNotes: As a prolific military intellectual, Li Erkang, editor of several military journals in Zhejiang, has published and translated countless military works, some of the most noticeable works are \"New Military Tactics Learnt in the European War\" (1916),\"Toxic Gas and Toxic Smoke\" (1928), \"National Defence and Supplies\" (1929), \"Japan's Military Understanding after the European War\" (1929) and \"Youth Military Training Course\" (1931). Some believe that part of the the military thought of Jiang Baili is inspired by Li, as Jiang highly praised Li's ideas in the preface of Li's \"National Defence and Supplies\", where Li calls for comprehensive national, economic and social mobilisation against inevitable Japanese aggression. As the mentor of Chen Cheng and sworn brother of Chen Lifu, Li Erkang is also well-connected in the rightist element of the KMT, and he tried to persuade Sun to cooperate with the KMT in the Northern Expedition.§!"

Sandino then gathered a group that came to be known as the 'Montañeses' and successfully attacked El Jícaro in November 1926. This victory granted him great renown and he was finally accepted by the Liberals, and would go on to become one of the national figures of the uprising. However, the Liberal victory in the war was short-lived, and with Moncada's betrayal, Sandino took up arms once again, this time leading a 300 men strong regiment in the south.

 SHD_wu_huawen_commander_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §L1904, in Laizhou, Shandong Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LWu Huawen was born to a Christian peasant family in Shandong, but accompanied his father to Mengcheng in Anhui Province at the age of 7. Different stories circulate of just what kind of life young Huawen led, he has sometimes bragged about coming from a rich peasant family and graduating from a private missionary school, and at other times claimed he was barely surviving as a starving farm boy. In one of these stories, he joined the army as an ambitious, nationalistic student, and in the other he enlisted after a flood destroyed his home. Either way, a teenage Huawen was initially serving as a cook and doing other menial tasks before he was recognised to be literate and appointed as a messenger. He was thereafter sent to serve in a garrison in Jinan, under the command of the then Zhili-aligned General Feng Yuxiang. Huawen bonded with his commander over their shared religious beliefs and Feng grew fond of the boy, vouching for Huawen's credentials and sending him to Beijing to pursue a proper military education in 1923. He drifted between different schools and eventually graduated from the Beiyang Army Academy in 1927, the same year that his mentor Feng Yuxiang was driven out of Beijing by the Zhili Clique. Huawen quickly denounced Feng and curried favour with the Zhili, earning a teaching position in Henan and was eventually assigned in 1930 as the commander of the very same Jinan garrison he had once served in. It was here he made common cause with Governor Zhang Zongchang and fell into his infamous "Zhang Clique". Huawen rapidly worked his way up the Dogmeat General's corrupt hierarchy and eventually cut ties to the Zhili Clique. He is known to have carved out a slice of territory for himself in Jinan and made contacts with other political forces in the province, in case his fortunes would shift. His habit of frequently sides between different generals and telling conflicting stories about his past has earned him an untrustworthy reputation. He carries two infamous nicknames, the first being "The Bastard of Three Fathers" as just like Lu Bu he has served three different masters, and the second being the "Jumping General".§!"

His father's tragic death in 1911 forced him to move back to Turin, where he received a scholarship to study law, although he would have preferred philosophy.\n\nTogliatti joined the socialist party (PSI) in 1914, just before the Weltkrieg, where he favoured Italian entry on the side of the entente. He finally graduated in late 1915 and despite wanting to pursue a degree in philosophy, he joined the Red Cross due to his myopia, later fighting in the front lines. When the ICW began he joined the republican front and later the 'red' faction that emerged.\n\nUnlike many other syndicalists, he strongly promoted militarism to reunite Italy under a syndicalist flag as soon as possible. This, combined with his opposition to the chaotic syndicalist system and desire for a more centralised government, led him to sympathise with the growing fascist movement. These sympathies became a formal alliance after 1927, when the Italian Federation collapsed but the SRI failed to pounce. Pressured by Mussolini, he eventually adopted the fascist manifesto as the PCd'I's party programme and was rewarded with the position of Mussolini's second in command.\n\nWhen Mussolini was murdered, Togliatti saw the chance of creating a new direction for the movement and took it. Rebuilding bridges with the trade unions while forcing them to accept increased central control and simutaneously denouncing blackshirt excesses, his rule appears to be a radical shift from Mussolini's.

The prince who has had a tumultuous past, being forced into exile both under Abdulhamid II in 1899 and two CUP governments, returned after the political détente in the wake of the Great War and has asserted himself as the main force within the decentralist movement.

 TUR_country_intro_content_3:9 "As formal peace finally arrived in 1920, the borders of the Ottoman Empire had largely remained the same. The oblasts of Kars and Ardahan were recovered, with the addition of Yerevan, whilst in the Aegean, the Italians were pushed out of the Dodecanese. The damage had been immense, however, as through the actions of the CUP, especially Djemal Pasha, tensions between Turks and Arabs had burst into the open, whilst in Eastern Anatolia and Mount Lebanon, whole populations were eradicated either through forced deportation or starvation. Losses on the Turkish side had been colossal as well, leading to under-population and a sharp decline in agricultural output - the Empire's main source of income.\n\nAlthough the Arab Revolt had been a colossal failure, the need for reform was recognised. Answering to the Arab Congress of 1913, limited reforms in favour of the Arabs were introduced, including the recognition of the Arabic as the second language for Arab-speaking regions.\n\nUpon being appointed Grand Vizier, Ahmet Rıza established a national unity government including all parties except the HIF. The turn towards post-war liberalisation began with the transformation of the Senate, previously fully appointed by the Sultan, into a half-elected body.\n\nIn the 1919 elections, Teceddüt skilfully took advantage of the divisions in the opposition, winning enough seats to form the government. Long-awaited reforms, postponed because of the war, were finally implemented, including the introduction of the modern calendar and the adoption of surnames. But increased criticism of Teceddüt by OHAF, and especially their most militant member, war hero Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu, led to the formation of a coalition government led by OHAF leader Fethi Okyar after the 1923 elections.\n\nHowever, even the new government did not satisfy Mustafa Kemal. Denouncing the \"weakness\" and \"compromise\" of Fethi Okyar, the hero of the Battle of Gelibolu gathered enough supporters to push back his old friend and become Grand Vizier himself by 1927."
 TUR_country_intro_content_4:9 "The 1927 elections ended in a victory for the now OHF, but many were quick to remark that this was less due to the party itself, and more due to the fragmentation of the opposition - where more than a dozen parties fought for any given seat. The newly appointed Grand Vizier did not hide his ambitions, and in a flurry of reforms he pushed the nation towards his ideals. Massive strides were undertaken in the areas of education, economic recovery, and the fight against the religious establishment.\n\nUnder threat from the rapid centralisation of the government apparatus, and with many conservatives afraid that the OHF may be attempting to break with tradition, the 1931 elections ended in the first electoral defeat for the OHF. The Osmanlı İdaresi Âdem-i Merkeziyet Fırkası (Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation), under its leader Haqqi al-Azm, became the grand winner of the elections and formed a coalition with the HIF to provide a united front against the growing centralist threat. The coalition, however, was under constant attack, as the various parties that took part in it had conflicting opinions on a non-OHF policy. Tensions reached a breaking point in late 1932, when the government of Haqqi al-Azm collapsed due to disagreement with the HIF. A new government was created under HIF leadership, but as a minority government, it failed to achieve its goals of decentralisation and liberalisation.\n\nThe continued failures of this coalition went a long way in repairing the reputation of the OHF, which received a solid majority in the 1935 elections. As Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu begins his second term in office, signs have started to appear that he may be looking for an alternative to the constant obstruction by the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies and interference from the conservative lobby through the Caliph..."

Home of the Diyarbakir Ulu Camii, the fifth holiest site in Islam and one of the oldest churches in the world, the city and its region suffered greatly during the last years of the Weltkrieg, as illness, fire and misery plagued its population.\n\nServing as an important strategic location for the Ottoman armed forces on the Eastern flank of the Empire, it is closely supervised by the Empire in the hopes of avoiding another confrontation with the Kurdish people. Resistance to Kostantiniye remains little for the moment, but fears of the far reaching secularisation promoted by the OHF and the centralised control rule within the Kurdish region, as they are afraid that without the uniting factor of the Caliphate, the Turks will slowly but surely push them out.§!"

During his early life, Abdülmecid enjoyed private education inside the walls of the palace, where he developed interests in music and arts. However, as per Ottoman traditions, he was not allowed to leave the palace until he had reached the age of 40. Still, he was happy, and over time grew increasingly content with the fact that he'll probably never be a Sultan.\n\nIn 1908, the year in which the Young Turk Revolution took place, Abdülmecid was finally old enough to leave the palace. He used his newfound freedoms to share his love for art and music with the world. He became the Chairman of the Ottoman Artists' Society, exhibited his paintings all over Europe, met with some of the most prominent musicians of the continent and learned to play new instruments.\n\nEven though Abdülmecid would have likely wanted to dedicate his entire life to music and arts, the world had bigger plans for him. On the 4th of July 1918, his first cousin Mehmed VI was crowned Sultan, a development which once again saw Abdülmecid become the heir apparent to the throne. After Mehmed had died 8 years later, Abdülmecid succeeded to the throne and was crowned Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of all of Islam. For most people, this would've been a dream come true - but for Abdülmecid, it was something he had never truly wanted. His apathy was one of the many reasons for why the Grand Viziers appointed during his reign managed to decrease the already diminished influence of the Sultan even further, turning him into nothing but a popular figurhead that mostly keeps away from politics, and whose main role it is to represent the Empire abroad. By now, the political power of the Sultan has come to an all-time low, and it seems unlikely, if not impossible, that this will change in the near future.§!"

Throughout the Weltkrieg, Reşit fought on many different fronts, including Gallipoli, the Caucasus, and Syria, earning himself the rank of colonel.\n\nAfter the war, Ismet embraced his role as the right-hand man of the famous \"Lion of Antep\", which also helped boost his own popularity. During the reign of the OHF, he supported Kemal in pushing through some of his most radical reforms, highlighting his secularistic and centralist notions. Now that Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu, Ismet's dearest friend, has passed away, he has taken it upon himself to fulfil the wishes of the Gazi and to turn his dreams into reality. Although following in the footsteps of a man such as Kemal will certainly not be an easy task, the party, and thereby the people, trust and respect Ismet and have chosen him to become the first president of the Turkish Republic, putting their future into his hands.

Afterwards, he served in Serbia and Albania, where he first made contact with members of the CUP. The Balkan War saw Fevzi serving as the Director of the 1st Division in the Western Army, where he was able to achieve some successes, but ultimately had to accept the defeat of the Empire.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Müşir achieved his first major victories, the most notable of which being the battle of Gallipoli, during which he commanded the V Corps. Later on, he also served on the Caucasian front and in Palestine. To honour his military achievements, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1918. However, just a month after his promotion, he had to return to Kostantiniye because of a sudden illness. There, on Christmas Eve, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Ottoman Empire. After the war, Fevzi embraced his role as a war hero and began to climb the ranks of the military ladder once more, with him being appointed Field Marshal at the recommendation of his dear friend Mustafa Kemal only a few years after the war's conclusion. During the post-war period, he stayed mostly in the background and refrained from interfering in the political matters of the state, instead focusing on the repression of partisans.\n\nThe recent political developments, however, have made him change his mind. Seeing the chaotic state the party was in, Fevzi deemed them unfit to rule, and now that he has secured his grasp over the nation, he plans on following his own visions, hoping to bring order and stability, not just to the party, but to the entire nation of Turkey.§!"

In the following years, Refet joined the Committee of Union and Progress, served in the Ottoman Gendarmerie, and fought in the Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars. With his competence and skill proven on the field of battle, he quickly began to climb the military ladder, making it to the rank of major by 1913.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, the Paşa commanded part of the Ottoman forces on the Palestinian front, where he managed to hold his line until the Ottoman defences were shattered by Allenby's advance in late 1918. Allegedly, the collapse of the Ottoman frontline also saw Refet get cut off from the retreating forces, forcing him to sneak his way across dozens of kilometres of enemy territory on his own.\n\nWith the end of the Weltkrieg, Refet Bele had become a famed and greatly decorated military officer. When Kemal claimed chairmanship of the former CUP in 1925, he was among the first to leave the party, since the Gazi's radically secularist notions directly contradicted with Refet's deep-rooted respect for the Sultan and the Caliphate. Staying mostly out of politics thereafter, the Paşa continued his service in the military, and, as such, took part in the defence of the Empire during the Levant Crisis. His efforts proved futile, however, and with the Empire in shambles, Refet felt the need to act.
