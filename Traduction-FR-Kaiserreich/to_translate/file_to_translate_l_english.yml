Focusing on Speed will allow the ship to outrun heavier warships and pursue lighter ones, much akin to a larger cruiser or a smaller battlecruiser. Focusing on Light Attack will create a strong \"cruiser-killer\" design able to destroy enemy raiders and deter destroyers. Lastly, Heavy Attack will deter enemy capital ships, forcing them to withdraw or commit to a costly attack."

The terms of the deal were that we would retain our domestic autonomy and nominal independence on the international stage as a Chinese protectorate, even if our foreign affairs were to be handled in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. This arrangement, a modern equivalent of the old Chinese system of suzerainty, implicitly included the retention of our current leadership in the [ROOT.GetRulingParty].\n\nThe Chinese have lost their faith in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government however, or perhaps they never truly intended to allow him (or at least his current crop of advisors) to rule. Already Chinese-aligned press outlets have taken a darker tone on the government in power and the Chinese \"Ambassador\" has been seen meeting with various opposition figures. Even more worrying is that major ministers and generals within our government are already jockeying for positions in the coming regime, suggesting our days may be numbered.\n\nWith our leverage effectively gone having already publicly announced our submission to the world and our patrons either unwilling or unable to help us, we have little recourse. It is only a matter of time before the Chinese formally submit their demands for a change in leadership, and unless we can take on the restored hegemony, the only thing we can do is hope history remembers this betrayal."

Therefore, we have exercised our just authority as suzerain to initiate a handover in power.\n\nAfter meeting with local politicians, military officers, and other stakeholders, our Ambassador has crafted a government more amenable to our interests. Though some have in the past participated in separatist activities, the new regime is either pragmatic enough or ideologically compatible enough to consolidate our hold over [FROM.Getname].\n\nOf course, [ROOT.GetLeader] and his cronies cried betrayal and whined about broken promises, but with their allies unable or unwilling to help, they had no real leverage over us. In the end they submitted peacefully, which is the important thing. We all can now look forward to that bright future and \"special relationship\" Chinese hegemony brings."

 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:9 "After the revolution and civil war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat.

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately shelved. In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee-Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce, though a bit heavier due to its barrel. An interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."

Yet, he would take a step further than most of his peers as he studied in the 3rd Class of the Staff College from 1909 to 1913, during which he would become a member of the Tongmenghui and be the roommate of Li Jishen, now known as a prominent Kuomintang military figure.\n\nBeing given the rank of lieutenant colonel after graduation, Ding served as a staff in Chahar against local bandits in the newly established Republic. In 1920, he was sent to his home province as a junior commander. As a well-educated and diligent officer, when Sun Chuanfang marched into Eastern China, he was recruited by Chen Tiaoyuan, who was under Sun but disagreed with his concessionist stance.

He entered the Baoding Army Accelerated Academy in 1906 and was later sent to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy to study infantry. During this time he made contacts with the Tongmenghui, briefly returning to China in 1912 to establish a revolutionary cell in Qingdao. Dengying was later driven out by the forces of Yuan Shikai and went back to Japan. His exile was short lived however, as sympathetic members of the Anhui Clique invited him back into the country just a year later.\n\nDengying then climbed the ranks of the armed forces, being promoted in 1923 to Chief of Staff for a Brigade tasked with supressing banditry in Shandong. By 1925 he broke with the Anhui Clique and attached himself to Sun Dianying's Southern Zhili Clique. It was here he got to know the \"Dice-Rolling General\", Chen Tiaoyuan, as they fought side by side in Jiangxi to drive back the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition.\n\nDengying forged a comradely bond with Chen, admiring the man for his strong principles and refusal to bow to foreign imperialists. After the Xuantong Restoration, he held a number of administrative posts on behalf of Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces, but ran up against the entrenched corruption in the Eastern provinces. His uncompromising attitude towards bribes, banditry and drug use drove Dengying to Anhui Province, where Chen recruited him to serve as the Deputy-Commander of the Anhui Army.§!\n\n§YNotes: Dengying is an avid art collector and amateur poet, primarily composing verses such as:\n\"In a place of seclusion in the mountains, with no official position or status, one must nevertheless have the eloquence to secure the state and settle the nation.\"\n\nHe is a leading figure within the Anti-Opium Movement in Eastern China.§!"

Luckily, the principal of a local primary school allowed this hardworking and active kid to study for free. During his studies, Chen was already well aware of the corruption and backwardness of his country and thus generated an eager and passionate sense of nationalism to save China.\n\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911, Chen Anbao, who firmly believed that only by joining the army could China be saved, immediately abandoned his studies, rushed from his hometown to Nanjing and joined the ranks of the Nanjing Provisional Government as a soldier, marking the beginning of his military career. Before enrolling in the 3rd Class of the Baoding Military Academy in 1914 to study infantry, Chen studied hard in a military academy in Wuchang.\n\nAfter graduating in 1916 with a remarkable performance, Chen was sent to the 2nd Division of the Zhejiang Army and served firstly as a platoon commander and then as a company commander. In drills, he was always the first to charge among his units and is thus highly respected amongst his soldiers. However, when it comes to fighting his compatriots on various occasions, he realised that he was simply reluctant to do so. Therefore, he was mostly absent in Sun Chuanfang's operations, later when Chen became increasingly disgusted by the collusion between the Imperialists and the League, he decided to join Chen Tiaoyuan's force and fight for an independent China.§!\n\n§YNotes: As a patriotic and daring commander, Chen Anbao will never hesitate to devote and even sacrifice himself for the greater good of the motherland.§!"

Founding the \"Renshen Club\" in Shanghai, Shi would espouse national capitalist and progressive ideals with fellow intellectuals, mobilising a series of groups to fight against Concessionist authorities.

Due to his high education level he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration.

Usually such events are retained merely for when one Clique's epoch passes onto another's, such as when Anhui fell and beget defections to the Zhili and Fengtian on the rise to their first era of prominence, or when Feng Yuxiang's betrayal in conjunction with the Second Zhili-Fengtian war saw defections from the Zhili onto the Guominjun, or furthermore to Fengtian.\n\nWith the most concerning news of Zhang Zuolin's death in his prized Northeastern Provinces, allegedly at the hands of the Japanese, and the rapid rise of General Yang Yuting to the position of Grand Marshal of the Fengtian Government, another wave of defections have poured out from Fengtian. Following his assumption of power, Yuting set forth purging all rivals or those that had even a thought of betraying him, including the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang and his loyalists.\n\nHowever, managing to avoid Yuting and his Shikan Clique for long enough, Shaoshuai stalwart Ma Zhanshan alongside two of Zuolin's old allies, Wan Fulin and Wu Junsheng, colloquially known as the \"Heilongjiang Clique\", have communicated through mounted messenger, informing [ROOT.GetLeader]'s field commanders of their intentions to defect. Whilst of varying degrees of skill, with Zhanshan known for his eccentricities, and Junsheng for his clumsy malaise, they nonetheless are fiercely vengeful for the death of Zuolin, seeking the deposition of Yuting.

Yet with the death of the Marshal, the cause for caution has been utterly called off — with Shikan's purge of the Shaoshuai Clique and other loyalists.

Despite arduous attempts from the Kempetai and Fengtian military forces to squash local provincial insurgent headquarters as they sprung up, the majority of attempts resulted in mixed failure. Whilst most success was won against Wan Fulin's area of the operation, Ma Zhanshan's cavalry forces managed to not only trump the Fengtian army, but the Japanese too. Whilst not inflicting particularly strong casualties, Ma's forces nonetheless could not be squashed. For his skill and notoriety, the Japanese have begun dubbing him the \"Napoleon of the East\".\n\nNonetheless, it would appear that the Heilongjiang Insurgency has ran past its expiration date, as in recent days much of the fighting in the province and neighbouring regions has subsided. With notably less troop movements than before, much of their radio channel's chatter has dissipated, and it's all but a foregone conclusion that their movement has ran out steam. Reports have even emerged that Wan, Ma, and Wu have all departed into Siberia, somehow aiming to return to a less hostile China, or forever remain in exile.

An expert at maintaining the primacy, mobility, and cohesiveness of his broadly cavalry force, Ma defiantly resisted to the brutal and bitter end. Rallying all loyalist forces on radio channels all throughout the Northeast, he gained notoriety for his surprising skill in guerilla tactics to the point that [ROOT.GetNameDef] troops and the Japanese have dubbed Ma the \"Napoleon of the East\". Much like Napoleon however, Ma Zhanshan fell to superior forces. Conducting a raid on his HQ, a local explosive would gravely wound the General's left hand.

Travelling back home once again, he would serve as General Manager of the Jilin Military Prep Department.\n\nJoining a series of Republican parties in the aftermath of Xinhai, Wang would be elected to the first Senate, joining Li Yuanhong's Republican Party, later merging into the Progressive Party. Serving in Yuan Shikai's Constitutional Conference on behalf of Anhui, Wang would support Yuan Shikai's monarchy ambitions, and after its failure would join Duan Qirui's Anhui Clique.\n\nHaving a tenure as Speaker of the Senate, Wang would organise the Anfu Club Party-State, effectively ruling China through a clique within a clique. Forced to flee to Japan following an arrest warrent after the fall of Anhui, Wang would participate in Duan's 1924 Government under Zhang Zuolin, becoming a vocal proponent and major figure. With Fengtian's withdrawal following the Third ZhiFeng War, Wang would become one of the most important members of the loose \"Recovery League\"."

Aiding Cao in overthrowing the \"Good People's Cabinet\", Wu personally present the Presidential Seal to Cao following his election.\n\nBelieving he had been deceived of his rightful Prime Ministerial nomination for all he had done, he would steal the Seal of the Assembly, and flee to Japan in exile. Returning a year later, Wu would attempt to join the Fengtian Clique through his cousin, Wang Chengbin, who had aided Fengtian in ousting the Zhili. Zuolin initially ignored Wu and Wang, forcing Wang to disband his soldiers and retire.

Due to his father's early death, he had to leave school without graduation and found work as a sales assistant in Frankfurt. He found socialism through unionisation - working to unionise sales assistants in his city, he ended up involved with the Free Trade Unions and joined the SPD itself. By 1905, he had amassed enough influence with his activism that August Bebel pushed him forward as a party secretary - however, the unions, which believed that Müller was too left-wing, blocked his candidacy.\n\nBy the Weltkrieg, Müller had moderated - he sharply criticised Rosa Luxemburg and positioned himself in the party's centre, between the revolutionary left and the right-wing revisionists. Still, for a time, he lost influence to Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann. Again, he answered with a pivot - this time a bit more to the left, preying onto the frustration with the party's cooperation with the Brockdorff cabinet and passivity, he advocated a more aggressive approach that could neuter the March Coalition and allow the formation of a centre-left democratic government. In 1930, he was finally elected as one of SPD's co-chairmen - the party's uncompromising position towards the Dirksen Cabinet that helped sabotage it in the leadup to the 1936 election is the result of his strategy.\n\nDescribed by his contemporaries as an 'objectivity fanatic', Müller is an unassuming, yet honest and precise bureaucrat, very much unlike his choleric comrade Otto Wels.

 germany.36.d:9 "The right have now consolidated their hold over the government of Germany, and the chance of the incumbent cabinet falling due to pressure from the Reichstag appears increasingly narrow. As article after article is printed on grand plans to dismantle the already fairly weak parliamentary system in Germany in order to replace it with decades of right-wing dominance, social democrats grow increasingly uneasy. This concern is especially held among the young generation of the SPD - who, unlike their predecessors, have a far different image of politics. While the party elders entered leadership during the Anti-Socialist Laws of the late 19th century and thus swore to always seek the most legal path to power to avoid a second period of repression, the politicians born in the 1890s or later never experienced this and thus are far more aggressive, though not necessarily more ideologically radical.\n\nWithin chapters of the SPD, trade union meetings and socialist study groups, tense discussion is taking place on whether the Social Democrats should take to the streets to fight for the defence of democracy - and it seems a large bulk of the party's mass membership are swayed by this rhetoric. Leading members of the SPD's Young Turks, such as Kurt Schumacher and Theodor Haubach, as well as the long forgotten yet existing radical left wing of the party, which includes such people as Max Seydewitz, Otto Grotewohl and Franz Lepinski, have been recognised as the leaders of this move. Though the party central committee still expects to just wait out a short-lived period of right wing rule, not everyone believes that democracy will simply defend itself."
 germany.49.d:9 "The beginning of the Second Weltkrieg caught German society unprepared. Since 1934, it has been occupied with internal conflicts partisan squabbles, all of which were far more relevant to the politicians and the common people than distant worries of another military conflict. Russian aggression in the East and syndicalist rearmament in the West were concerning, for sure, but the expectation was that the undefeated Imperial Germany Army will make quick work of the aggressors.\n\nAs a result, the German Empire enters the war unprepared, and rapid mobilisation policies will need to be passed in order to hasten our rise from slumber. Yet, do we truly have the time?"
 germany.61.t:9 "Eyes on Silesia"
 germany.61.d:9 "A dilemma for the SPD election campaign has surfaced in the Polish-dominated districts in Posen, West Prussia and Upper Silesia. Traditionally, this is where the Polish National List, an alliance of the generally Christian conservative and nationalist Polish parties and a member of the Minority Bloc, performs well and wins several constituencies. Though generally right wing and fairly close to Zentrum, the Polish National Democrats and Adalbert Korfanty's Christian People's Union, who dominate the alliance, are pragmatic enough to work with the left. Yet, the Polish districts have their own left-wing party - the Polish Socialist Party of the Prussian Partition (PPS zp), led by Józef Biniszkiewicz.\n\nTheir relationship with the SPD is troubled - they split off from SPD in the 1890s, allied with it, broke the alliance, renewed the alliance, then broke it again during the Weltkrieg because of growing Polish nationalism. In 1920, they re-aligned with the SPD, but separated again in 1925 when the SPD cooperated with the government of Reichskanzler Brockdorff-Rantzau and the PPS accused them of nationalist sympathies. Now, seeing the growth of the German right, Biniszkiewicz offers to move past these differences. He would be interested in joint SPD-PPS candidates in two constituencies in Silesia, which would be Biniskiewicz and PPS's co-leader Franciszek Trąbalski. Working together, we may actually defeat the Zentrum candidates in their constituencies, but do we really want to trust the PPS? Not to mention that the right-wing Polish nationalists may not be happy with this either..."

 germany.62.d:9 "Today, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, Member of the Reichstag for the Conservative Party from 1931 to 1936, announced his political retirement. He will instead focus on his memoirs and the Colonial Society.\n\nLettow-Vorbeck is, of course, more commonly known as the Lion of Africa, the commander of the German forces in the Ostafrika front of the Weltkrieg. With a small force of mostly African soldiers, he held back massive British, Portuguese and British Indian occupation forces for five years and even occupied bits and pieces of the British Empire, being the only German commander in the war to do so. He returned to Germany after the war and was given a hero's welcome.\n\nThough he accepted the March Constitution, his conservative views eventually drew him to the DkP and he left retirement to participate in the 1931 Reichstag election, winning his constituency against a Zentrum candidate. His time in the Reichstag was unremarkable, and though he made certain comments on military reforms, he remained a background figure. Ahead of the election of 1936, Lettow-Vorbeck joined the moderate voices arguing against the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition with the DVLP and cited Alfred Hugenberg, an 'uncontrollable demagogue', as one of his reasons. Instead, he believed the DkP should back a Schleicher Cabinet.\n\nThe DkP's poor electoral performance did not save the war hero in his constituency. At an advanced age, he was unable to do more than the bare minimum campaigning and was ultimately defeated by the Zentrum fresher Peter Altmeier. Undefeated in the battlefield of old, the Lion of Africa was finally defeated in the battlefield of the modern - the electoral campaign."

In fact, the renewed question of the Party's relationship with the Schleicher regime has sharpened the existing fractures within. Up until this point, the SPD and the Reichskanzler have been in a system of uneasy toleration - urged by the left and neorevisionist wings, it has criticized him for abuse of his powers and demanded lifting of his emergency powers, yet have avoided going further than that. The party's leaders, Hermann Müller and Otto Wels, believe that a violent confrontation with the government could result in a new Anti-Socialist Law, which 'would be disastrous and spell the end for the German labour movement'. Privately, they hoped that Schleicher could still 'return to his senses'.\n\nThis is intolerable for the party's enraged 'Young Turks' - and still too far for its revisionists. The conflict came to a head when the party's most revisionist members, Gustav Noske, Wilhelm Buck and Theodor Leipart, founded an 'Association for the National-Social Community' inside the SPD, whose purpose was to promote toleration of the Schleicher government and form a 'national socialist' coalition between the SPD and the National Unity Front in Saxony. The Young Turks immediately put forward a petition, counter-signed by Otto Grotewohl, Max Seydewitz, Theodor Haubach, Julius Leber, Carlo Mierendorff and others, to expel the Association from the SPD.\n\nMüller, however, refused to address the petition, but at the same time forbid the revisionist Saxon Social Democrats from forming a coalition with DNEF for the time being. This balancing act ultimately proved to be his undoing. The left wing soon announced their departure and the formation of the democratic socialist Socialist Workers' Party (which the Schleicher government soon began suppressing), while the Saxon SPD openly defied the party's leadership and established a coalition with the DNEF under the leadership of Minister-President Robert Wirth. The SPD has split, and its passivity has proven to be its undoing."

The newly-elected conservative-federalist leadership of the Zentrum Party around Schäffer welcomes the appointment of the Kleist government, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition. Schäffer himself has lauded the nationalists' united efforts against the Schleicher administration to prevent pseudo-revolutionary experiments and military-imposed centralisation attempts, and expressed his hope that the new government will take a tougher line than previous governments in defending both Germany's domestic order and the European order in the name of international peacekeeping."

Franz von Papen, notable leader of the Prussian Zentrum wing, was one of the first to speak out against the decision. He was soon joined by a chorus of voices from Bavaria, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg. A clash in Catholic media followed for several days, with reactionaries demanding a renewed coalition agreement with the far right and progressive statesmen such as Joseph Wirth and Matthias Erzberger aggressively criticizing such proposals.\n\nUntil finally, the impossible came - Zentrum has split. The Bavarian, Alsatian-Lotharingian and Luxembourger branches, already highly autonomous, have fully severed their ties with Zentrum, and they were joined by several Reichstag deputies led by Papen and Heinrich Dieckmann. Together, they have established the Federalist Union (Föderalistische Union), a right-wing Catholic conservative and federalist party which fully endorses our conservative agenda.

Since the very beginning, the forces of democracy fought against the deeply rooted aristocracy, the interests of reactionary business owners and corporations, the influence of an all-powerful Prussian army, and the machinations of the monarchy. Among the workers, the Social Democratic Party arose and became the most powerful party in the country; from the heterogeneous conflux of German liberalism, a united Liberal People's Party ultimately formed; within the Catholics, a desire and a will to reform the Empire towards inclusion and democracy finally took over.\n\nToday, a union of the democratic forces has vanquished the reactionaries of the conservative-nationalist bloc and the deceitful rise of the militarist Schleicher. And it is not led by a weak figurehead appointed by the Kaiser, or a moderate selected from the Liberals or Catholics - no, for the first time in the history of the German Empire, a Social Democrat holds the highest civilian office of the land. Hermann Müller, the leader of the parliamentary group of the SPD, has assumed the position, and will chair a cabinet composed of representatives from all of the members of the Coalition - a partisan government through-and-through. Already, hopes and dreams race in Social Democrat leadership discussions - what reforms will they finally be able to push forth, now given the means to do so? Has the time come for a Second Parliamentarisation of the Empire?

 gerflavour.90.d:9 "The announcement that Hermann Müller was appointed Reichskanzler came with shock and surprise among much of German society - as, up to this point, the SPD always being passed over for the post seemed like a fact of life. Kaiser Wilhelm II was long known as a staunch opponent of the Social Democratic Party, and the figures surrounding him were hardly any better. A few journalists on the Frankfurter Zeitung speculated whether old age had finally eroded the Kaiser's old reactionary views and brought back the brief 'People's Kaiser' ambitions of his youth - but, in truth, Wilhelm II's distaste towards the SPD was the same as ever.\n\nAs Kaiser and King of Prussia, he is advised by a privy council - the Privy Civil Cabinet (Geheimes Zivilkabinett), which has been nominally subordinated to the Prussian government since 1920. The two leading figures among this circle of advisors are Konstantin von Neurath and Louis Müldner von Mülnheim, both conservatives and loyalists to the monarchy - yet, at the same time, reasonably pragmatic. It was them who advised Wilhelm II to accept the Reichstag's recommendation - however, not from the kindness of their hearts. As Neurath argued, 'the Social Democrats gather such support because they are an unknown entity, a shapeless cloud of wishes and desires of the rabble... giving them chance to govern for a year or two will shatter all the illusions'. Not only that, but he and Mülnheim believe that a SPD government will quickly galvanize the conservative right.\n\nThis, of course, also relies on the belief that the Social Democrats will flail, flounder and collapse once in power."

 gerflavour.91.d:9 "French syndicalist propaganda, seeing little distinction between the Kaiser and the German government, have been quick to claim that 'Kurt von Schleicher, serving the Kaiser's will, promulgated the Enabling Act to create a Junker-led absolute monarchy...'. The truth is a little more complicated than that. Ever since his appointment, Schleicher has been buttering up the Kaiser with promises of restoring national stability, controlling the far left, rebuilding the economy and so on, often through the Crown Prince, an old friend of the Reichskanzler's.\n\nWilhelm II, however, has been expressing certain worries and concerns about the Schleicher government to his privy council - the Privy Civil Cabinet (Geheimes Zivilkabinett), nominally subordinated to the Prussian government since 1920. There is a reason why he has hesitated to appoint military men as Reichskanzlers in the past - it brings memories of Leo von Caprivi, that 'sensitive old fathead' and the last military Reichskanzler of the German Empire. And it was not just his military status which brought back memories of the 1890s - attempting to neutralize the 'revolutionary threat' through a policy of compromise and absorption of the more positively minded elements of the left, which Caprivi too embodied.\n\nToday, however, the Kaiser's levers are much weaker - which was the source of concern. What if Schleicher starts going too far and goes against the Royal family, much like Caprivi did? What if it is too late at that point? Wilhelm II conveyed those anxieties to his son during a meeting of the Privy Cabinet, but it didn't seem like he was listening."

The Privy Civil Cabinet (Geheimes Zivilkabinett), nominally subordinated to the Prussian government since 1920, has been filled with reactionaries and conservatives, generally handpicked from the nobility, since its formation, and though they've had their moments of pragmatism, such as opposing the regime of Hindenburg and Ludendorff and supporting a negotiated peace, they are generally the exact people who'd be most likely to subscribe to the new coalition's political programme.\n\nThe Kaiser, however, made it clear that he was 'not expecting much' from the government. Certainly not a restoration of his Personal Regiment days, for sure. Why? Well, the Black-White-Red coalition may claim to be defenders of tradition and the monarchy, but was it not the Conservatives who were a thorn by his side before the war? Was it not them who protested the Mittelland Canal, who raged at his ministers and at his Weltpolitik ceaselessly? And the Fatherland Party - the heirs of Alfred von Tirpitz? The same man who plotted behind his back after being dismissed from his post, to the point of theorycrafting a military coup to overthrow his own monarch and put in a 'Bonapartist' dictatorship? 'Republicans, the lot of them', he says to his privy councillors.\n\nOf course, perhaps they have changed somewhat. But, as the Kaiser says, that still means he can only tolerate them.

Historically divided between bourgeois and proletarian organisations, it is currently dominated by the heterogeneous Federation of Women's Associations (BDF), led by Agnes von Zahn-Harnack. Zahn-Harnack and most of the association's committee are affiliated with the LVP, and seek to maintain a balance between moderate bourgeois women (primarily concerned with the right to vote), liberal bourgeois women (who also focus heavily on education equality) and conservative Catholic and Protestant women. Their main opponent, the Proletarian Women's Associations, have steadily declined, both due to the death of their longtime leader Clara Zetkin and also because of their tepid support for women's suffrage, primarily concerned with the rights of women in the workplace. The new leadership of the movement under Emma Sachse have embraced the call for women's suffrage to adapt to the times.\n\nPetitions for women's suffrage, frequent in the preceding decades, continue - but are we interested in giving them the vote?"

Founded in 1903, the Community was a homosexual advocacy group and literary association, one of the first of its kind on the planet, and the largest rival of the late Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. Brand himself was a fierce opponent of Hirschfeld until his death in 1935, even though both of them nominally fought for the same goals.\n\nBrand disagreed with Hirschfeld's scientific and medical approach to homosexuality and instead promoted an aesthetic, Greek-like understanding of manly brotherly love between 'virile men'. He virulently opposed Hirschfeld's idea of connecting male homosexuality with femininity and claimed that homosexual love was superior to heterosexual love, often to the point of outright hatred of women. In addition, Brand and his Community grew notably antisemitic and right-wing overtime - since the beginning, they maintained connections with the nationalist Wanderwogel movement, and later on toyed with the idea of a German homosexual 'Übermensch'.\n\nBecause of this, Brand hoped to find sympathy from our conservative government, yet his hopes were dashed and he was ultimately arrested for violating public decency laws. After a week, Brand made a bargain with the Prussian authorities - he will be released in exchange for giving up on all his activism. Already in financial ruin due to most of his wealth and literature being confiscated, he is certain to cause no troubles for us henceforth."

Similarly, our relationship with the small, but existing far-right veteran organisations, youth leagues, and other associations has waxed and waned. Now that we are at war with the Syndicalists, they have completely muted their criticism of our regime and instead propose collaboration.\n\nThe DSP and other far-right organisations claim to have experience combating Syndicalists and social democrats on the streets and would like to form a cooperate combat organisation and neighbourhood watch, the Auxiliary Police (Hilfspolizei). This organisation would support state police in policing the streets, reporting Syndicalist spies and traitors, and maintaining order in occupied territories. Subordinate to the Prussian Secret Police, it would be headed by First Weltkrieg veteran and physician Leonardo Conti. The extremism of many of the likely Hilfspolizei members is concerning to more moderate members of our government, though - especially as it's possible that the officialized DSP and DvP activists will use their positions of power to settle scores with social democrats, liberals and Jewish citizens.\n\nShould we give the green light for this initiative and establish the Hilfspolizei?"

It was led by Member of the Reichstag Karl Höltermann, himself a Weltkrieg veteran and journalist.\n\nThe organization's intention was to serve as the paramilitary arm of the 'all-German democratic movement', supposedly transcending party boundaries, although it was social democratic in practice. However, it was short-lived. The Prussian Secret Police infiltrated the organisation from the beginning, and the reactionary government in Prussia ordered it to be banned on the grounds of 'sheltering Syndicalist activists'. Faced with the full power of the state, the Self-Defense could not defend itself and surrendered without a fight. Six hundred arrests followed, including that of Höltermann and several other notable Magdeburg SPD leaders.\n\nWhat little motivation there was among the German social democrats to resist with force has been crushed. Their passivity and decades-long desperation to integrate into the political establishment have made them completely impotent when the call for resistance came."

Ignoring the boos of his party's members trying to shout Schoenaich down, Hassell took the floor and began a long, impressive speech.\n\nHe began with an event from over twenty years ago - in 1914, fighting in the trenches, he was shot in the chest and still 'carries a French bullet in his heart'. Despite this, and despite his experience of French socialist extremism during his time as diplomat, he claims that he never held bitterness towards France nor sought a war with it. According to Hassell, France is a key part of the pan-European spirit - without it, or Italy, or Germany, or even Russia, Europe is just a rump, and they all contribute to a common European spirit - be it Germany as the engine of Europe and its natural leader or France as a birthplace of statesmanship and culture.\n\nWhen Europe fights itself, it declines from its rightful place as ruler of the world - and the Syndicalists, who deny the Christian, national, proud spirit of Europe and replace it with socialist decadence, are the instigators of this fight. They, Hassell claims, intend to spread their venomous ideology and further embroil Europe in bloodshed. This could be seen in the violent spread of syndicalism to Britain and elsewhere. Thus Germany's hand has been forced and, as Hassell finishes, it must save France from itself. Only once Syndicalism is erased from it can it rejoin the family of European nations and become part of a new, stronger Europe which once again dominates the world.

One of the magazine's targets is the Reichskanzler, Hermann Müller - particularly, they focus on how little of a public figure he seems to be. 'Where is Herr Müller? Has he camouflaged himself in the wallpaper to avoid the great right-wing conspiracy?' they ask.\n\nEvery joke has a grain of truth in it - even his close allies agree that Müller is an unexciting political figure, very unlike the young and active Carlo Mierendorff, or the fairly charismatic Otto Braun, or even the choleric and authoritarian Otto Wels. Described as an 'objectivity fanatic', he is more at comfort in his office or his room, talking to small groups, reading books or writing himself. He impresses many of his party's members with his sense of clarity and considerable expertise and is thus respected by most in the SPD, yet this does not translate to notability or fame outside of the party secretary's office.\n\nTo an extent, Müller is fine with this - sincere and even somewhat self-deprecating at heart, he states that he does not wish to put himself in situations which are 'not his area of expertise' - this includes grandiose speechmaking.

A wide coalition, it would certainly resist all of the measures of the Conservative Revolution and attempt to tug us back to the decrepit March Coalition consensus. Yet, paradoxically, as time passes, it is actually us who have begun tugging Zentrum to the right. Despite their pragmatic nature and willingness to cooperate with the liberals and the SPD, Zentrum has always kept them at arm's length, and now, with each party conference, the influence of the federalist Zentrum right has grown with one new appointment into the party's central committee after another. Zentrum's centre itself has grown increasingly conservative, now openly disavowing 'socialist experiments' and promoting close Catholic integration into the conservative Volksgemeinschaft. The Catholic trade union heavyweight Adam Stegerwald has offered his full cooperation, proposing promotion of non-socialist unions and stronger persecution of 'Syndicalist elements' in exchange for becoming Secretary of Labour.\n\nWe should make use of his and other Zentrum leaders' services - and construct an alliance of the conservative, bourgeois middle to ward off extremism from both sides.

Most of the German population of Bohemia is concentrated in the border regions, collectively described as 'Deutschböhmen' (German Bohemia). Separating them from the rest and annexing them into the surrounding states may seem appealing at first, but it is believed that an ethnic Czech state could not survive without German-speaking border areeas.\n\nThis is not a problem for pan-German nationalists, who believe that the rest of Bohemia-Moravia can be controlled as a protectorate run by collaborationist officials and a German military presence. A more liberal and democratic alternative is to establish united Bohemia as a member state of the Empire instead - granting it a democratically elected parliament and allowing Czech territories to send representatives to the Reichstag.

Surprisingly, they have decided to take the next step - speaking before the delegates, Franz von Papen announced that he intends to become a member of the DNVB and will 'bring as many nationally-minded, patriotic Catholic men and women under the aegis of the all-conservative organisation'. This was followed by loud applause by delegates from Bavaria and Alsace-Lorraine. They, too, proclaimed the same decision - finally abandoning Catholic particularist politics and joining their Protestant compatriots in one all-Christian party.\n\nAt last, the long-sought dream of German conservative revolutionaries has been achieved - the division between Catholic and Protestant conservatives has been overcome! Crucially, this also includes the government of the second largest state of Germany, Bavaria, which is now a DNVB stronghold.\n\nAnd what does this mean for Zentrum itself, forced to shed its right wing? They will most likely move to the opposition, but without the SPD around, it will only be them and the increasingly marginalised Liberals, and even what's left of them may rip apart among the lines of toleration of DNVB or opposition to them, cooperation with underground Social Democrats or distance from them..."

 gerflavour.103.t:9 "[GetYear] SPD Leadership Conference"
 gerflavour.103.d:9 "Hermann Müller, the first Social Democratic Reichskanzler in the history of Germany, has announced that he will not seek another term as First Chairman of the SPD and intends to leave the leadership behind for the next generation. It has been known for years that Müller is not in great health, especially after surviving a major health scare in 1931, and even if one ignores that, he is hardly a young chicken by now. The SPD, meanwhile, needs new energy to continue its fight for the interests of the working class in the postwar era.\n\nA party conference has been organised in the city of Bielefeld, where the neorevisionist wing put forward the candidacy of journalist, newspaper editor, Hamburg councillor and, since 1936, Member of the Reichstag Theodor Haubach. One of the two key leaders of the neorevisionist wing and thus member of the overall 'Young Turks', alongside Carlo Mierendorff, Haubach has been in the headlines for the past decade, and his influence in party has only grown. After all, the Demokratische Union government was a perfect example of neorevisionist policy - a coalition with the liberals and Catholics which moves the SPD away from old socialist theories and instead transforms it into an active combatant for liberal democracy and social reform.\n\nAfter Mierendorff and Kurt Schumacher curried favors with the party centre and old revisionists, the Conference voted in favor of Haubach's candidacy - but with a catch. The conference will elect him a co-Chairman, who will come from another faction in the party and thus 'restrain' him, creating a balance and preventing a full neorevisionist takeover."
 gerflavour.103.a:9 "And who will that be?"
 gerflavour.104.t:9 "The Co-Chairman of the SPD"
 gerflavour.104.d1:9 "The conference has voted for Max Seydewitz, Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. A surprising choice, it is a clear example of the growing strength of the left wing of the SPD - he was most strongly promoted by Secretary of Education Otto Grotewohl as well as the left-leaning Socialist Youth, though he also garnered surprising support among the veteran theoreticians of the SPD. The party's revisionists and rightists are nervous, but have accepted the result for now.\n\nSeydewitz's acceptance speech makes it clear that he intends to promote the SPD's Marxist, socialist roots, even in the post-syndicalist age, and will focus on organising the youth and the rank-and-file members of the Party. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d2:9 "The conference has voted for Wilhelm Sollmann, Member of the Reichstag and Under-Secretary of the Interior, as Haubach's co-Chairman. Considered to be a member of the right wing of the party, he has been described by a few as a 'neo-Staatspolitiker', a pragmatist in the same vein as Otto Braun and Carl Severing, and also has a nationalist streak, such as his support for pan-Germanism. Liberal newspapers claim that Sollmann's victory, especially promoted by Braun, Severing and the other revisionists, happened in response to the SPD's very troubling time in the Demokratische Union government, including a significant marginalisation of the left.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Sollmann focused on the necessity of cooperation between the Social Democrats and the other pragmatic, pro-democratic forces in the country - the SPD needs to continue displaying its pragmatic credentials and show that it remains capable of leading the country. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d3:9 "The conference has voted for Adolf Schärf, formerly member of the parliament of Austria, later Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. With Austria's recent integration into the German Empire, the Austrian SDAP has integrated itself into the SPD, quickly becoming one of the party's largest branches - and they actively demanded an Austrian co-chairman ever since their integration. It appears that their demands have been met.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Schärf focused on the need for a 'full unification of Germany' spiritually and culturally, while also repeated his firm alignment to the Social Democratic party program. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d4:9 "The conference has voted for Fritz Baade, trade union official and Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. In the Social Democratic Party, he is most famous for being the co-author of the Tarnow-Baade Plan, which, in spite of initial reservations, was adopted by the SPD during their time in government and led to an impressive economic recovery. Also known as the party's foremost expert on agriculture, Baade was crucial in formulating the party's response to the German agrarian crisis.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Baade put most emphasis on the claim that the SPD is a party for the workers first and foremost - and then criticised the party's 'intellectual core' for spending too much time 'theorizing' instead of helping the working class. Needless to say, his memories of Rudolf Hilferding's scepticism towards the Tarnow-Baade Plan are behind his divisive claims. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d5:9 "The conference has voted for Fritz Naphtali as Haubach's co-Chairman. Known as Rudolf Hilferding's protege, Naphtali is one of the party's most influential economic theorists and a promoter of 'economic democracy', as well as a notable critic of the Tarnow-Baade Plan. His victory was easy to predict - among the party centre, he is perhaps the most prominent leader who is not one foot in the grave.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Naphtali focused on the future of the German economy, claiming that he will work on a new theory of economic democracy and a new party program which more adequately represents the conditions and needs of postwar Germany. He lodged criticism both towards the ADGB and their 'nationalist influences' as well as the 'intransigence' of the party left. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."

 gerflavour.105.d:9 "Erich Koch, one of the two chairmen of the Liberal People's Party, has announced his resignation after a year of ceaseless criticism from the party's right wing.\n\nDespite the ambitions of the left and right liberals to form a broad 'party of the middle' through their unification, the agony of German liberalism continues, the LVP yet again forced to back one party or another instead of getting the chance to form a majority themselves. Erich Koch, representing the more left wing, 'social liberal' wing of the party, was among the members who pushed for the LVP to leave the March Coalition in 1935, in vain hopes of bringing progressive and moderate SPD voters to themselves - after that floundered, he hesitantly supported a coalition with SPD as opposed to one with Zentrum at the helm.\n\nHere, he's been opposed by the 'Big-Tent Liberal' wing, helmed by his co-chairman Julius Curtius - national and pro-business in outlook and hostile towards socialism, they were perfectly fine with the March Coalition and launched a full-scale attack towards Koch for destroying it. They've also been pointing out their dissatisfaction with the Demokratische Union government - according to them, it is clearly a 'socialist government' to which its coalition allies are merely necessary votes to implement their socialist agenda.\n\nAfter Koch's resignation, an emergency LVP conference will be held which will decide his replacement. Curtius will certainly seek to put in another right-winger in his place, but the party's left will hardly surrender their leadership position."

His victory is a clear signal that the rank and file members of the LVP support working with the SPD, as opposed to the right-wing pro-business minority which would prefer a coalition of the centre instead. In his victory speech, Nuschke stated that he will promote a 'reform-minded centre' course, offering an olive branch to the party right but also making it clear that constitutional reform and stronger protections to democracy will be his primary goals."

The right wing of the party cheers, while the left are concerned by the result.\n\nRheinbaben is a rare liberal aristocrat in German politics and a representative of the 'Big-Tent Liberal' wing of the party, sometimes also described as the 'Stresemannites' after the influence which their late leader Gustav Stresemann had on their direction. Stresemann's influence also runs deep in Rheinbaben's career and he proudly describes himself as the former Vice-Chancellor's protege. Financed by large businesses, the Stresemannites are highly sceptical towards the SPD, seeing their left-wing platform as a threat to their interests, and promote a wide coalition of the centre instead. Rheinbaben emphasized as much in his victory speech, stating that he envisions the LVP as a broad party of middle which resists 'international Marxist experiments'. As his co-chair, Julius Curtius, is also no friend of the SPD, the LVP is certain to be a lot more hostile towards the Social Democrats from now on."

 gerflavour.108.d:9 "For the first time in German history, women were able to cast their votes alongside men in the election to the Reichstag - and not only that, but also run for office. Almost all major political parties included at least a few women among their candidates nationwide - while the Socialist Party, the SPD and LVP are the most closely associated with politicised women's networks, there were several conservative women on the Catholic list, whereas the Reifenstein Association and evangelical women's organisations managed to run a few of their candidates under the aegis of the DkP and DVLP. In the end, eleven women were elected to the Reichstag.\n\nAmong them were heavyweights who were already well known as leaders or influential members of women's organisations, such as Marie Juchacz, Antonie Pfülf and Luise Kähler from the SPD, or Gertrud Bäumer and Agnes von Zahn-Harnack from the LVP. Others were less known. The youngest, Elisabeth Schwarzhaupt, is only slightly over 40 years old and was delegated by the LVP. Perhaps the most famous, however, was the entrance of longtime Socialist Party ideologue and intellectual Rosa Luxemburg to the Reichstag, as only one of SP's two deputies. However, at her highly advanced age, it is unlikely that she will play a notable role in the Reichstag proceedings.\n\nThe entrance of the first women to the Reichstag ranks is lauded as a great achievement for women's rights in Germany. Perhaps, one day, if things go incredibly well, women representatives may make up as much as a fifth of the Reichstag!"
 gerflavour.109.t:9 "The New Police Union of German States"
 gerflavour.109.d:9 "The formation of the first conservative government since 1923 has not been taken by some in German civil society well. Certain far-left activists, generally belonging to FAUD and the Socialist Party (SP), are now joined by a number of Social Democratic and progressive liberal figures, attempting to form a united front against the government. Meanwhile, in the highest levels of government, there is a yearning for more heavy-handed measures against such treasonous agitation. The memories of the Ruhrkampf are still fresh, as well as Reichskanzler Schleicher's non-committal response which nearly caused an actual rebellion on German soil.\n\nRespecting the authority of the German states, Kleist's government has refused ideas of a federal 'secret police' thus far, but now a very attractive alternative has emerged from the state level. After the 1848 revolutions, many German states formed a temporary Police Union of German States to cooperate against revolutionary agitation across state lines, and a similar project has now been established to crack down on socialist activity nationwide. Prussia, Bavaria and the smaller states have entered a voluntary network of cooperation, sharing intelligence and cracking down on these treasonous activists no matter where they may flee.\n\nAlongside this, the government has given its support to an initiative proposed by the Prussian government - a militarised 'security police' (Sicherheitspolizei) established in each of the German states which would break up riots and crack down on violent activists. Already, we're seeing the initiative yield results - dozens of known traitors or their sympathizers are being arrested every week."

Instead, they have begun a strategy of 'parliamentary baiting', targeting our left wing - constantly putting forward left-wing proposals in the Reichstag and pressuring our left to break ranks and vote alongside them, as they'd betray their socialist principles otherwise.\n\nA particularly problematic law has been put forward by SP's Member of the Reichstag Paul Levi today. Citing the Empire's ongoing economic struggle, he proposes dedicating up to three billion Reichsmarks from the budget to public works, job creation initiatives and nationalisation of three of the worst performing banks in the country. To finance such an enormous investment, the law provides for cuts to next year's military budget. Decried as 'hyper-inflationary nonsense' by Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht and 'akin to treason' by Chief of General Staff Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, it is guaranteed to be defeated in the Reichstag, but our left wing is restless, several of their leading figures offering shockingly supportive statements on Levi's proposals.\n\nOur coalition partners demand us to join them in voting the law down and thus show our commitment to fiscal discipline - but this will certainly be a slap in the face to our left wing, and a few of our Members of the Reichstag may even defect to the SP outright."

Though presenting itself as a loyal imperial party, the SPD has always been sceptical towards higher military investments and have locked in the pacifist vote - one of their slogans during the 1936 election was 'Kinderspeisung statt Panzer!' (Food for Children, Not Tanks!). Many of the party's Reichstag deputies intend to vote against the package. This opinion isn't shared by their allies, though, and they demand the package to be passed for the sake of national security.\n\nIt's a question of betraying the party's program, or ruining the party's relations with their coalition partners and thus risking its collapse outright.

 gerflavour.112.d:9 "This deliberately sensational title adorns the book recently published by conservative revolutionary journalist and economist Ferdinand Zimmermann (or Ferdinand Fried), one of the members of the Schleicher-aligned Tat Circle. After the collapse of the Berlin stock market and the beginning of the worldwide economic crisis, he began putting his thoughts on the international economy to paper and now the first version of his study sees the light of day.\n\nZimmermann echoes the views of certain socialists by predicting that free-market liberalism, free trade and economic growth are on the decline - which he claims is driven by technological stagnation and cultural decadence. Innovation has ceased, he says, and the captains of nineteenth-century industry had been succeeded by a generation of incapable sons. Meanwhile, the very nature of the free market is self-destructive, as Zimmermann predicts that the rise of non-European powers will lead to the decline in demand of European goods and the unraveling of the world economic order.\n\nThe solution, he claims, is extensive state planning and economic nationalism while ensuring that mid-sized private enterprises retain the freedom to organise their operations within certain parameters. Germany must establish and dominate a certain 'great space' (Großraum), which Zimmermann identifies as Mitteleuropa - which would be severed from the dying global economy and achieve self-sufficiency. These economic ideas have gotten significant interest within the Schleicher Cabinet, and it's claimed that Schleicher himself owns a copy of the book."

Keeping silent for much of the first year, he's returned to action - and he is furious. Through numerous, and in his eyes miscalculated spending policies, Germany has accrued debt which will take several generations to repay.\n\nThat is, unless we do something about it. Schacht proposes a program of austerity, balanced budgets and deflationary measures to bring our currency back under control. The budget surplus gained through this program would then be invested in servicing our debt.

 gerflavour.114.d1:9 "It took us a lot of cajoling and pressure to make it happen, but the Kaiser - and, just as importantly, the men around the Kaiser who could convince him - has finally been convinced to fire Hjalmar Schacht. After Schacht's corruption scandal during the First Weltkrieg did not convince him, a breakthrough was achieved by Otto Braun, the leader of the SPD in Prussia, who managed to get a personal meeting with the Kaiser. Wilhelm II was, reportedly, very impressed by Braun and later stated that 'my friends had told me that Otto Braun was a fanatical rabble-rouser. Now I see that he is a quite reasonable person with whom one can talk about everything'.\n\nIn Schacht's place, Wilhelm II has appointed Wilhelm Röpke, a professor of political economy in Marburg and a notable younger generation economist, as President of the Reichsbank. Though a student of Ludwig von Mises, Röpke diverges from him on the free market, believing that certain intervention in the market is necessary to uphold human rights, morals and collective interest - a 'third way' theory of economics, as claimed by some. Close to Zentrum politically, though a Protestant, Röpke should be more cooperative with our government than the bitter austerity advocate Schacht."
 gerflavour.114.d2:9 "With the reestablishment of the Prussian Privy Council, the conservative-picked advisors and councillors eventually convinced the Kaiser that Hjalmar Schacht has outlived his usefulness and he has to go. Though not everyone had an issue with his work, not the least the Kaiser himself - after all, before Black Monday somewhat dampened his reputation, he had kept the Mark stable for over a decade - the undecided advisors were finally convinced through the pressure of the government.\n\nIn Schacht's place, Wilhelm II has appointed Karl Helfferich, former wartime Vice-Chancellor and state secretary. Though considered to be closer to the reformists twenty years ago, he took a sharp turn to the right after the war, and is now firmly associated with the anti-parliamentarian right. As an economist, he is considered to be somewhat unorthodox, but is a highly respected expert nonetheless, and is likely to be less strict on state spending."
 gerflavour.114.d3:9 "After Kurt von Schleicher's old friend, Crown Prince Wilhelm, was informed of the government's frustrations with Hjalmar Schacht, he quickly brought the Reichskanzler's note to his father and soon returned with his stamp of approval. As Kaiser Wilhelm II is in a very advanced age, his heir has already been fulfilling many of his functions, and even moreso with Schleicher at the helm, often even bypassing his father and acting as the representative of the throne without his knowledge. This matter was one of them.\n\nIn Schacht's place, Wilhelm II appointed Johann Ludwig Schwerin von Krosigk, an Anhaltian noble and nonpartisan Finance Secretariat official, considered to be a fairly unnotable yet efficient manager of fiscal affairs. Though a supporter of traditional fiscal policy, Krosigk is noncombative and states that he will focus solely on running his office with the parameters he is given, and will not make any public appearances.

Because of needed compromises with state governments, the war ministries of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Württemberg will continue to exist, but the Imperial War Office will take precedence.\n\nThe question, however, is who exactly becomes the first holder of the office. Our up-and-coming military affairs expert is Julius Leber, a Weltkrieg veteran who moved to politics after the war and now sits as a member of the Reichstag. He is considered affiliated with the Hofgeismar Group, a part of the Young Turks - throwing the youths a bone could calm them down somewhat. There's no telling if the Heer will accept a Social Democrat in charge of military affairs, though - so, an alternative is to appoint a nonpartisan general. Major General Erich von Bonin is one of a handful of high-ranking commanders who are tolerant towards the reformist parties, and a rare advocate of military cooperation with the SPD - and, having already held official positions in the Prussian Ministry of War, he would be qualified for the post.\n\nOur decision will determine the precedent regarding the Secretary of War - will we insist on civilian control of the army, or will we try to meet the military half-way and leave their autonomy be?"

 gerflavour.116.d:9 "The passage of the Wilhelmine Constitution has brought about near-revolutionary change to the fabric of German civil society, yet nowhere has this transformation been more pronounced than within the Jewish community. During the war, shared opposition to Russian aggression earned Jewish political organisations, and the previously much-maligned Ostjuden, a level of sympathy and influence they had never before experienced. Numerous Jewish aid groups, many of which arose during the conflict and continue to work tirelessly to rebuild Europe, have been widely credited with strengthening the Jewish contribution to the war effort.\n\nA spirit of realignment now pervades the Jewish political sphere, as groups once divided by distrust begin to make amends. Most notably, the LVP-aligned Zentralverein has softened its stance towards the Ostjuden, who largely support the SPD and SP. The Zentralverein has also reached an understanding with the ZVfD, whose new, less intransigent leadership has opened the door to improved relations. While reconciliation between the assimilationists and the Zionists will require further time and patience, the first steps have been taken.\n\nFor the first time in modern German history, the political landscape is largely free from the stain of antisemitism. The new moderate right, led by the CVP, can even boast a growing number of conservative-leaning Jewish supporters, despite the party’s Christian roots.\n\nWhatever the case, with the Wilhelmine Constitution and the new era ushered in by our government, Germany stands at the threshold of a new golden age."

During the June 16 incident, he would side with Sun Yat-sen, participating in a mutiny orchestrated by Li Jishen. Despite considering himself a \"staunch follower of Sun Yat-sen\", Chen was critical of the presence of Russian and French advisors, and Sun's pro-Internationale foreign policy, putting him firmly in Hu Hanmin's right-wing of the Kuomintang. He would stay in Guangdong during the Northern Expedition, fighting off the remnants of Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army before making a desperate attempt to stop the German Expedition as part of the Fourth \"Iron\" Army. Hu Hanmin's purge by Chiang Kai-shek put Chen in an awkward position within the party, and when the Northern Expedition failed, he disavowed Wang Jingwei's leadership of the KMT and followed Chen Mingshu back to Guangzhou, now back in Chen Jiongming's control.\nDespite having opposed Chen Jiongming, Chen Jitang soon came into conflict with Chen Mingshu because of his progressive platform and alignment with the KMT's left-wing. Instead, he was won over by his former enemy's economic policy and sensible leadership, which saw increasing prosperity for his beloved Guangdong.

 HNN.military.7.d:9 "Whilst at home it may appear as if Chen Quzhen is the true King of Xiangxi, even Kings submit to Emperors, and such an affair is no different for the polity of Western Hunan. Under the authority of the Xiangxi Garrison Office in Changsha, Tian Yingzhao is, at least in the provincial capital, the true authority of the region. Of course, de-facto and de-jure are entirely different beasts, and whilst tenuously the relationship holds, few can say if Tian is still Chen's overlord - despite all pretenses pointing to Chen's undying and unwavering loyalty to his master. In any case, it is not particularly as if Tian Yingzhao, a friend of Sun yat-sen, of Zhao Erxun, of Xiong Xiling, of Yuan Shikai, and of Zhao Hengti, is any state of mind to conduct statesmanship let alone command on the field.\n\nRife with a life of abject failure, Tian has achieved not much of anything, and such a state of affairs has weighed heavily on his consciousness. Ever since the late 1910s, the once ambitious and vigorous general has been reduced to a depressed, chronically addicted layabout. All affairs, even menial, are delegated to staffers in Changsha, and Chen Quzhen in Xiangxi proper. His students, Liu Xiang, Yang Sen, and even Chen all appear to have far surpassed their master.\n\nHowever, it is not all over. Considering the circumstances in the province and the necessity for a strong officer staff, alongside a friendship that resolutely surpasses all boundaries, Chen Quzhen has proposed to [ROOT.GetLeader] in a personally written letter, asking, nay, pleading that the government finance a state recovery campaign for the general of once great stature. Insisting that Tian's knack for weathering the storm and the organisation of soldiers could be crucial in the wars to come, he has requested a modest fee for rehabilitating his old friend."

O'Kelly, also known, from his numerous writings over the years, by his pen name Sceilg. Joining Sinn Féin at their inaugural meeting, helping sway the Irish public to support the defeated rebels in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, and serving as a minister during the War of Independence, [IRE_loc_leader_title] O'Kelly has been around for every major Irish event of the century, and watching the Republic he swore his utmost loyalty to fall into corruption following the sellout that was the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it was his ironclad determination to set things right that brought him to the position of authority he now holds.\n\nAlthough a diehard republican, O'Kelly's ideals are not built upon the Godless influences of the French Revolution which he abhors. Instead, he seeks inspiration from classical republicanism, and rejects the liberal decadence which favours the selfish needs of the individual at the expense of the common good of the nation, and the willingness to sacrifice for it. Though the state he has shaped is nominally democratic, its voting process and corporatist structures are designed to ensure that those elected are not Anglophilic, Jewish or Masonic elements wily enough to hoodwink the masses, but rather men and women of virtue.\n\nWith power consolidated securely in the hands of those who uphold patriotism, Christianity and Ireland's native tongue, Sceilg, as a strong chief akin to the Taoisigh of old at the country's helm, watches vigilantly over the Republic he rescued from those who sought to defile it and the sacrifices made by so many Irish martyrs. Like Daniel O'Connell, who he admired in spite of O'Connell's moderacy, it is certain that O'Kelly will go down in the history books as a great liberator, having fulfilled his lifelong mission to safeguard the isle and its ancient culture from the scourges of liberalism, imperialism and syndicalism alike."

By the end of the Weltkrieg, the \"Król cygański\" rose to prominence once again thanks to the influence of the Kwiek Family. Despite strict instructions from the Germans that they could not refer to themselves as \"Kings\", this dynasty have been the de-facto leaders of the Polish Romani for several decades, working to resolve conflicts between different tribes and toeing the government line. Even so, these locals are quite audacious in how they present themselves. In 1930, \"King\" Grzegorz Kwiek began to speak about \"holding court\", and in 1934 started making radical declarations of re-establishing a Roma homeland on the shores of the Ganges.\n\nThe latest inheritor to the Kwiek Family's title is Janusz Kwiek, saw fit to arrange a ceremony where he was \"crowned\" by the Archbishop of Warsaw, Antoni Szlagowski, but he alleges this was merely to confer authority among the squabbling Romani clans, many of whom had begun speaking of deserting Poland in favour of establishing a new Roma homeland in South Africa or Ethiopia. Despite this, the Polish press has been jokingly referring to him as \"Janusz the First\", a mocking gesture against the authority of King August IV. Thus far, we have deigned to ignore this jest, refusing to acknowledge the so called \"King\" among the Roma as anything more than a powerful figure in this local minority."
 polandflavor.44.t:9 "Splitting Hairs"
 polandflavor.44.d:9 "News has reached the administration in Warsaw over an internal conflict within the \"Old Catholic Mariavite Church\" based in Płock. Ever since its founder, Sister Maria Kozłowska, perceived by them as a saint, passed away in 1921, the Church was headed by Archbishop Jan Maria Kowalski. The Archbishop's reforms, which he called \"understandings\" were controversial to say the least. First was the introduction of Holy Communion under both both kinds during the anniversary of the founder's death, followed by removing the celibate and introduction of so-called \"Priestly Sisters\", with one of them even becoming a Bishop. As a result of these reforms, many have left this denomination and rejoined the Roman Catholic Church. However some wanted to remain within the Church, but remove the problematic Archbishop.\n\nAs such, two meetings of the church elders were called, which ended with removal of the Archbishop Kowalski, forced renouncing of his goods and relocation from Płock to nearby Felicjanów. Archbishop Jan Maria conceded and moved to Felicjanów with a circle of his followers, but soon after, they called the proceedings of the elders illegal, claiming that the spiritual leader cannot be removed, but can only resign. This decision caused a split in the Church, which ended up with most followers remaining loyal to \"Płock Denomination\", however many left the church altogether.\n\nAfter the split, the \"Płock Denomination\" would keep the name of \"Old Catholic Mariavite Church\", while the \"Felicjanów Denomination\" would go back the the first original name of the Church, \"The Catholic Mariavite Church\". Soon after, Archbishop Jan Maria was imprisoned after an appeal from the leader of Płock Mariavites, Bishop Klemens Maria Feldman, who also called on the local government to secure the Felicjanów assets, to \"prevent them from being plundered by other Mariavite sisters\"."

 polandflavor.45.t:9 "Mariae Vitam Imitantes"
 polandflavor.45.d:9 "The Mariavite Church is based on doctrines and actions of Sister Maria Franciszka Kozłowska. Originally the Sister-Superior of \"Poor Sisters of Saint Clara\", in 1893 she claimed to have visions from God that she called \"The Work of Great Misericordia\", after which she became known as the \"Mateczka\". The visions criticise immoral actions of the clergy, which in turn corrupts the believers. Only way to fix it is the cult of the Blessed Sacrament and imitating the life of Saint Mary. Due to the visions happening in a time of great corruption within the Polish Church, the Sister's revelations attracted some followers. Soon she presented them to bishops of Lublin, Płock and Warsaw, and even went as far as to presenting them to Pope Pius X.\n\nIn 1904, the Roman Inquisition decreed the dismantlement of Mariavite Congregation and made Sister Kozłowska a persona non-grata. After attempts to initiate the decree in 1906, many parishes declared independence from their Bishops and converted to Mariavisitm. This caused Pope Pius X to condemn the church in his \"Tribus circiter\" enciclica, however the Tsarist administration fully legalised the Church.\n\nThe church decreed for masses to be held in Polish, instead of Latin. They also reject the Catholic doctrines about Indulgences or Papal Infallibility. While Mariavites limited the Cult of Saints, after the passing of \"Mateczka\" she instantly became revered as the most important saint. The recently imprisoned Archbishop Jan Maria Kowalski of \"Felicjanów Denomination\" went even further in belief reforms. After alleged visions from God, he declared the new Holy Trinity composed of Jesus Christ, the Son, God-Father in the form of Saint Mary, and the Holy Spirit, taking the form of \"Mateczka\", the Saint Sister Kozłowska."

Fighting in the first Sino-Japanese War, he would be assigned to Yuan Shikai, and would play a key role in fighting against the Xinhai Revolution. In 1912, Cao orchestrated a mutiny to provide Yuan an excuse to avoid meeting Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing.\n\nA supporter of Yuan's Hongxian Emperor bid, Cao led forces against the Huguojun in the National Protection War, where he was wounded. Becoming a significant power player during Duan Qirui's tenure, he would be Dujun of Zhili Province, and would succeed Feng Guozhang as informal leader of the Zhili Clique in 1919. Allying with the Fengtian Clique against Duan Qirui, they would wage the ZhiWan War, and soon after the ZhiFeng War.\n\nWith outstanding victories, Cao and his protégé Wu Peifu would dominate the political scene, but Cao's Presidency, achieved through bribery, tarnished his reputation, especially after suppressing Wu's \"Good People's Cabinet\". Drafting a progressive constitution, Cao faced dejection and house arrest following Feng Yuxiang's revolt in 1924. After his release, he fled to Henan and, alongside Wu, would fight for the Zhili Clique's survival in the Northern Expedition.\n\nNegotiating with Germany, Cao would manipulate strings to see the Xuantong Restoration come to fruition in 1928 in exchange for substantial aid at little to no cost. Fighting the Third and Fourth ZhiFeng Wars shortly afterwards, Cao and Wu would again become the two most powerful men in China.

After the outbreak of the November Riots Movement, he sent telegrams to the Presidential Palace and State Council in the name of the Assembly, praising the movement for \"doing their utmost for the country\".\n\nBecoming increasingly corrupt, Bian would become good friends with figures such as Cao Kun, Wu Yulin, Qi Xieyuan and Wu Jinglian.

Forming the Tianjin faction with Cao Rui, and Wang Chengbin, he would inherit the mantle once Cao Rui died in 1924.\n\nChosen as the organiser of Cao's election, Bian would spearhead the efforts to opt for bribery as opposed to legitimate election, albeit ultimately being dismissed due to Wu's opposition.

It was the cardinal sin of the entire Russian people to turn on their Tsar and slay him, some have argued, and demanded amends be made by all of Russia. All this has given strength to the 'Movement of the Tsar-Redeemer' - or 'Heresy of the Imperial Redemption' as it is called by its critics, which seeks to put the late Tsar into a wholly sacred position, even capable of redeeming sins.\n\nA commonly cited proof for this is the writings of the 18th-century monk Abel, who has been claimed to have prophesied many important events in Russian history correctly.\n\nOf Nikolay II he prophesied: 'He will have the mind of Christ, long-suffering and the purity of a dove... He will replace the royal crown with a crown of thorns... There will be war. A great war, a world war... Through the air, people, like birds, will fly, under water, like fish, they will swim, and they will begin to exterminate each other with fetid grey. On the eve of victory, the royal throne will collapse. Brother will rise against brother... the godless power will scour the Russian land...'\n\nThis idea of Nikolay II as an almost Messiah-like figure, a sacrifice for Russia's many sins, has risen again and seems ever more attractive to the faithful, seeking some meaning to the civil war.\n\nLess fervent proponents of the movement are merely calling for sainthood and the building of a new church in Yekaterinburg, where the Tsar and his family died, to become a site of pilgrimage for all Russian faithful."

Some hope that the threat of resignation would pressure [RUS.GetLeader] to back down from his most radical plans, but this does not seem probable.\n\nThey do admit that if it is the wish of the Russian people to transition into a socialist-esque system, they will not shed blood because of it - but they also cannot continue serving under such a regime. Their words do include a warning - if this new Russia loses the support of the people, and veers into Bolshevism, the Volunteer Movement will rise again, as many times as necessary.\n\nIn lukewarm cooperation with the government, generals have received pensions and will retain their ranks, retiring as honoured parts of the army. Some have even accepted remaining as military educators.

 socrus.404.d:9 "Comrade Grigory Zinovyev, passionate internationalist, was an obvious choice to represent Russia before all of the International. His connections within the global socialist movement allowed the VST to be accepted as the sole Russian representation. In its most recent session the topic of the signatories of the Totalist Charter became a hotly discussed issue, questioning their compatibility with international socialism. Zinovyev took to the stage for an address. He reminded the delegates of the Bolshevik call for a strict organisational, theoretical and programmatic unity so that the international could be more than a propaganda association, but rather a single communist party having branches in different countries. The new International had failed to safeguard itself against revisionist, social-patriotic and petty-bourgeois influences. While there was little doubt who this referred to, Zinovyev explicitly condemned 'left-republican' and 'Mosleyite' tendencies, causing an uproar from many of the delegates that took time to calm. He made clear where the blame for this was to be placed - a laxity in discipline, a hysterical respect for democratic forms even against the interests of the proletariat, and an attitude far too tolerant to parties whose practice and tactics are in flagrant opposition to those of the revolutionary proletariat.\n\nThe International's plenum was greatly stirred by Zinovyev's speech, and intense conversations broke out among the delegates as soon as it ended. Some among the syndicalist and communist left saw sense in his words. Many of the left and centrist factions were shocked and confused, feeling themselves implicated, while others rebuked the harsh anti-democratic tones, calling it "Totalism against Totalism." The Totalist Charter signatories responded harshly, denouncing Zinovyev as an ultra-left madman hell bent on curbing national autonomy. Most agitated, however, were the other VST delegates, who were furious that Zinovyev had made such a bold statement without consultation. Soon after, telegrams were sent to Moscow, condemning Zinovyev and waiting on [ROOT.GetLeader]'s response."

The chance of the Germans accepting such a demand is null, but it would at least give the appearance of legitimacy to Russia's actions - something especially important as Russia wants to portray itself as a democratic and sensible nation.\n\nOur army chief immediately disagreed. An ultimatum will ruin the element of surprise of the operation, giving Germany and their allies time to mobilise their defences and halt the Russian offensive. He then suggested an alternative: as to not disrupt Operation Yekaterina, a demand would be sent to Berlin to immediately cease hostilities immediately after our troops crossed the Ukrainian border.\n\nUltimately, this option was settled on, and further preparations continued."

He is a man of extremes: what he loves, he loves to the end, and what he hates, he hates just as passionately.\n\nAll the myth surrounding his person is in no small part thanks to his own writings and the fanatic followers he has the ability to inspire. Born into a well-off middle class family, young Boris grew up in Warsaw, where his fascination with the revolution began - a path he walked to its logical extreme: through years of terrorism, war, and, finally, all the way to the Kremlin. He successfully remade himself from a revolutionary terrorist into an ideologue and the leader of the Northern Volunteer Army, and by the end of the civil war, many followed him into the Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom - an organisation dedicated solely to Russia's messianic fate, to restore it with blood, no matter the cost.\n\nTo his followers, he is a man to spark inspiration and adoration, promising a vision of the Third Russia that no other politician in Russia dared to promise. Around this vision of an entirely new form of nation, the ideology of National Narodism was founded on the same principles as those of Savinkov: the heroic death and the beauty of new dawn after the darkness.§!"

 serpuppet.100.d:9 "The Serbian Monarchy has had a storied history, with the House of Obrenović emerging as Princes of an independent Serbia shortly after the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Raised to a King in 1882, their Austro-philic foreign policy drew the ire of Pan-Serbian ultranationalists, who staged a bloody palace coup in 1903 and killed King Alexander I. The National Assembly then invited the exiled Petar Karađorđević, descendent of an earlier Prince Alexander deposed by the Obrenovićs, to take the throne, reflecting a shift towards an Russo-philic foreign alignment. Contrasting with the generally unpopular King Alexander I, King Petar I was fairly popular for respecting constitutional rule and reigning during Serbian victories in the Balkan wars.\n\nSerbia's fortunes took a turn for the worse in the Great War. Crown Prince Alexander I, who effectively took charge of the monarchy after the start of the war, narrowly avoided losing the throne to the Montenegrin Prince during peace talks. His father abdicated the throne rather than accept the separate peace Alexander lobbied for, and thus Alexander became King Alexander II of Serbia.\n\nThe ensuing Treaty of Wartholz was deeply unpopular in Serbia, and Alexander's rule took an authoritarian turn in 1919 using a miners' strike as a pretext for his Obznana. With the help of Prime Minister Vojislav Veljković, Alexander ruled through the Central Powers backed \"State Party of Serbian Democrats\", turning the nation into a de facto royal dictatorship. Just a few years later however, the King was shot dead in 1925 amid mass protests, throwing the nation into chaos and resulting in the creation of the republic.\n\nHis son, Crown Prince Petar, was whisked into exile. The question of the monarchy by and large fell to the wayside in the ensuing years, with territorial revanchism often taking priority. However, with the fall of Belgrade once again to foreign powers in just a generation, the Serbian political scene is back at a crossroads. It will be up to us to \"guide\" this new state in the correct direction."

 TEX_george_smith_patton_desc_body:9 "George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major on June 31st, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg's use of mechanised warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. In the past few years, Patton has had major falling outs with MacArthur, now vocally and constantly opposing his colleague."

Being both the cause of a breakdown in relations between the two allies, and the glue that can mend them, the Ottoman-Azerbaijani delegation has come up with a possible solution to the issue.\n\nIf we were to relinquish our influence in Azerbaijan and allow it to pursue the closer relations with the Turks it seems so eager to, the Turks would be willing to formally enter the war on our side tipping the scales in the Eastern Mediterranean in our favour. As a show of good favour they are also willing to lease the Baku oil production to us for a period of 25 years if we were to withdraw as soon as possible."
 ottfor.71.d:9 "Although there have been disagreements about the other topics, the toughest nuts have been spared for last as the matter of Azerbaijan has kept both Turks, Azeris and Russians awake at night. With Russian intentions to absorb the Azerbaijani state into their empire, claiming a need for fuel and the restoration of old Russian lands, Turkish and Azerbaijani diplomats have been hard at work to develop a plan wherein Azerbaijan can serve as a buffer state between the two empires. This plan, which includes Russian rights to the exploitation of Azerbaijani oil for the duration of the Russo-German war and a lease for 10 years afterwards, has been positively received by the Ottoman government, but has thus far failed to convince Moscow. With the threat of war rising, further concessions regarding the rights of its Russian population and the Orthodox minority have been proposed, hoping to avoid an open conflict."
 ottfor.72.d:9 "To ensure that their Eastern flank is secure and to protect the status of their Turkic brethren in Baku, the Ottoman government has demanded that Azerbaijan be excluded from any imperialist ambitions. Working together with the Azerbaijani government, they have however promised a fair amount of concessions to make our stance more pliable.\n\nThe Azerbaijani oil reserves, desperately needed by the Russian war machine, will be leased to [RUS.GetNameDef] for a period of 10 years or until the end of the Russo-German war whilst special rights will be granted to the Orthodox population of the small country, protected by [RUS.GetNameDef]. In exchange, the Ottoman government demands the complete independence of the Azerbaijani government and the right to connect their capital to the Ottoman rail network."

As the Hetman's foreign minister and later Otaman-Minister, Doroshenko could not find the time to complete his historical works. However, his retirement shortly after the conclusion of the Anti-Hetman Revolt gave him the opportunity to focus solely on building an account on Ukrainian history, covering events as early as the Greek colonisation of the coast and as late as the Anti-Hetman Revolt.\n\nDoroshenko's work presents an even-handed approach to the late Hetman's rule, acknowledging both his achievements in the fields of foreign affairs, industry, and trade, but at the same time condemning his unwillingness to accept democratic reforms and his heavy-handed methods of suppressing dissent. The former Otaman-Minister carefully tip-toes around the still-unresolved issue of Pavlo's death, which has served to inflame the most conservative elements of Ukrainian society, who still hold radical leftists guility. \n\nDoroshenko's heavy involvement in the significant reforms undergone by the Ukrainian state in recent history has served to greatly increase interest in his book, which is quickly becoming a best seller."

In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called \"one of the most distasteful orders I ever received\". He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.§!\n\n§YNotes: Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country.§!"
