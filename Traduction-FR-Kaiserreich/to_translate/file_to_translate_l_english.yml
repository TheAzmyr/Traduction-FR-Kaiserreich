 ireland_events.1009.d.dem:9 "$ireland_events.1009.d.start$ Although the majority of loyalists had grudgingly accepted joining the hated Irish Republic as an alternative to syndicalism, the burning of Irish, British and German flags atop these bonfires took off during the interwar period, as an avenue to express passive resistance.\n\nThough the month was always a nervous affair due to the ever-present ethno-religious hostilities, the rise of AN, the NLCL and the UPL made the build up to this year's twelfth particularly tense, as June and early July were marked by an increase in reports of sectarian violence perpetrated by Blueshirts and UPL supporters. These mounting tensions exploded on the Twelfth itself, as a confrontation broke out while an Orange Order march passed through a Catholic area, escalating into a riot. Gardaí were ineffective at quelling the rioting, with allegations spreading of local Gardaí siding with rioters from their own communities, and by the end of the day several people were dead and many homes destroyed."

With all eyes now focused north, the government has found itself in an even more tricky position as public pressure for reform has become all the more intense."

While the Príomh Aire's influence ensured that the Gardaí attempted to sweep such crimes under the rug, the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, denouncing sectarianism, stepped in to protect the threatened Protestants where the government failed, their clashes with their azure-shirted foes drawing public attention to the attacks and criticism of O'Duffy's continued ties to the supposedly disbanded National Guard."

Ironically, in a twist few would have expected a mere decade ago, many feel deep alarm at this announcement of their erstwhile master-turned-ally's collapse in spite of the suffering the empire once caused the island and its people, though those opposed to the government's pro-Entente stance on the other hand are naturally more than happy to celebrate the demise of Ireland's former oppressors, who did so much damage to its ancient culture and language.\n\nIn the north, loyalists have been struck with dismay and horror as the monarchy they have upheld and vowed to defend, even at the price of cooperating with their age-old Irish Catholic foes, appears in mortal danger. For the majority of moderate loyalism, this has only reinforced their determination to stand alongside [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in opposition to their mutual enemies, despite their misgivings. However, radicals decrying the Crown they served's perceived abandonment of Ulster as part of the terms that brought Ireland into the Entente have began to advocate for an independent Ulster[IRE_loc_ENG_status]"

Indeed, with the vote split between four significant parties, no candidate was able to reach an Electoral College majority, just as was the case four years ago.\n\nWhat was not expected was the disastrous performance of the Democratic Party: coming in fourth place, they will be excluded from January's contingent election, leaving the Republican and Farmer-Labor candidates to compete with Huey Long for the support of Congress to decide who will be elected the next President.

 germany_flavour_events.121.d:9 "Now that a true conservative government is in power in Germany, it immediately came to conflict with the government of Prussia - where, through Schleicher's machinations, a Frankenstein of a coalition was constructed to place Otto Braun as Minister-President. Though he has to battle the House of Peers to get pretty much anything passed, Braun has turned his cannons in our direction as well - loudly proclaiming a plan of 'non-cooperation' with the Kleist cabinet. Some more moderate voices, such as Gottfried Treviranus and Walter Lambach, proposed striking a deal with the uppity social democrat, but they were shouted over by a majority of the coalition which demanded his blood.\n\nA kingdom-wide petition campaign, gathering signatures from voters opposed to Braun, was started by the Conservative and Fatherland Parties, intended to show the government and the Kaiser the breadth of resentment against him. Through the Agrarian League, the Navy League, volkisch organisations, and right-wing unions, over a million signatures were gathered in mere weeks. They were joined by a surprising ally - far-left activists, 'national syndicalists' and Proletarian Front Fighters whose resentment of the Social Democrats was deep enough that they'd support any attempt to topple them, even one led by the far right. After all, if the SPD is destroyed, the workers will have no choice but to start a revolution!\n\nIt did not take long for Wilhelm II to fire Braun and order the formation of a right-wing coalition in Prussia under the leadership of Minister-President Tilo von Wilmowsky, who immediately proclaimed his intent to work with the Kleist government on all matters."

Studying there for 6 years, Losol would take on his education with a sense of tenacity and hunger. Studying languages and devouring religious texts, Losol would travel abroad in 1908, driven by his desire to learn. Utilising the Manchurian railway, Losol would travel to Beijing. From there, he would pass through Buryatia, and then onwards to Petrograd and Moscow. Influenced by the Xinhai Revolution and the liberalisation occurring within Russia, he would return to Mongolia just at the right juncture to see the Bogd Khanate established.\n\nServing as a lama in the army of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren, the occupation of the Chinese would see Losol join the Züün Khüree, becoming one of the \"First Seven\". Joining Sükhbaatar, Dogsom, and Choibalsan in Russia, Losol would attend the First Congress of the Mongolian People's Party, being elected to its Central Committee. Seeing service in the failed MAN revolutions, Losol would slowly accumulate influence within the party in the interim. Utilising his connections with the Seven, and with the young guard, Losol would be elected the party's Chairman.\n\nNow seeing his revolutionary party finally take the reigns of power in Mongolia, Losol's priorities are divided.

Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, seized power.

Most Tseghakronist hardliners have been imprisoned by government forces or have chosen the path of exile, with Hayk Asatryan, one of Nzhdeh's closest associates and one of the leading ideologues of the Tseghakronutyun, now hoping to carry on the work of his paragon from beyond the seas and to foster the movement in the diaspora.\n\nMeanwhile, the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland had long been split between the autocrats under Nzhdeh's guidance and the democrats who opposed his radical views. With much of the military, however, having chosen to align themselves with Boghos and thus the democrats, most militarymen once loyal to Nzhdeh have likewise used their chance to stand on the victorious side of the power struggle, and have promised the new government their continued support and loyalty. With Nzhdeh and his extremist forces thus having largely lost their footing in our country, it seems that the position of the new regime has been secured, and that the era of terror heralded by the Tseghakronists has become nothing but a relic of the past."
