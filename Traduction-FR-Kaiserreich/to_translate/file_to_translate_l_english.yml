 american_civil_war_events.30.d:9 "With the Revolution in full swing and society fully polarized into two great camps, the task falls to the SPA to steward the Proletariat along its path to a communist society: of course, as Marxists, the SPA understands that society's progression is based fundamentally on the relation of its economic classes to its means of production. After all, our Revolution is not merely political or even economic: it is social, paradoxically a rejection-and-fulfillment of the ideal of Social Democracy. Prominent Industrial Unionist and leading party Theoretician Louis Fraina has taken the floor of the congress to argue that in the present moment the WCA has the opportunity to enact a decisive change: the total equalization of all pay - specifically, by letting local Communes collectively set wages. While thus far local Communes have fixed Prices and handled the distribution salaries, the institution of a single universal salary for all workers would be a massive step in the decommodification of production - and thus the ending of capitalism.\n\nProgressive Caucus leader Norman Thomas took the stand to warn against a hasty adoption of Fraina's motion, warning that such a move could drive away many newly radicalized moderates among so-called skilled labor and the other petit bourgeois forces that joined our cause, namely many local AFL chapters, Farmer-Labor affiliates, and even Proudhonist-minded Anarchists. Sticking to the most radical of prewar agreements, tepid as they seemed now, at least for the duration of the Civil War, could serve as a vital means of incentivizing the military production necessary for victory. The final vote was close, but ultimately..."

President [TRK.GetLeader]'s government has been providing training and steadily funnelling weapons to various groups in the region opposed to Russian domination, including Bukharan dissidents and Kazakh rebels on the northern side of the border, all in anticipation of their impending clash with the Russians. Our military mission has had its hands full in organising Madamin Bek's forces, but von Niedermayer is requesting that we send more significant aid. After all, every Russian who falls in these mountains and deserts is one less we must face in the steppes of Ukraine."
 central_asian_crisis_events.104.d.noadvisors:9 "Our military observer in Central Asia, Oberst Oskar von Niedermayer, has been reporting on the events unfolding in Turkestan. President [TRK.GetLeader]'s government has been providing training and steadily funnelling weapons to various groups in the region opposed to Russian domination, including Bukharan dissidents and Kazakh rebels on the northern side of the border, all in anticipation of their impending clash with the Russians. Bearing this in mind, von Niedermayer has recommended the General Staff to send a full military mission to Tashkent, alongside proper military supplies. After all, every Russian who falls in these mountains and deserts is one less we must face in the steppes of Ukraine."
 central_asian_crisis_events.106.d:9 "The Kremlin sent us an angrily worded note on German military presence in Central Asia. In the note, disseminated publicly through newspapers, they demanded Germany to respect Russia's territorial sovereignty, including territory currently occupied by rebel forces. While Russia has unofficially agreed to tolerate the independence of Turkestan, they still officially view the country as an autonomous region of Russia, and have recently categorised Madamin Bek's government as a bandit insurgency. Bearing this interpretation in mind, Russia has accused us of openly supporting foreign rebels through our mission led by Oberst Oskar von Niedermayer, and has called on neutral states to pressure us to withdraw from the region by pulling out our military advisors in Madamin Bek's service. They have attempted to gain foreign diplomatic support to pressure us to withdraw, claiming that our support is tantamount to German imperialism on Russian soil."
 central_asian_crisis_events.436.d:9 "The grand host assembled in the farmlands surrounding Samarkand is unlike any which has been seen in Central Asia for years - a massive collection of militias, soldiers, and tribal levies, all under the watchful command of our loyal Atalyk, who leads vigorously from his tent in the centre of this enormous and unwieldy collection of military power. While our assembled army is neither cohesive nor disciplined, it remains an impressive display of our resources and resolve, a veritable horde of fighters committed to our cause.\n\nWith these resources available to him, Ibrahim Bek could easily surround Samarkand and choke the city through a siege - the sheer size of his forces would allow us to block off each of the paths in and out of the ancient city without fear of being locally overwhelmed by the meagre rebel forces. However, Ibrahim Bek is keen to put our might in full display by bottling up the defenders before moving into the streets, smoking out all resistance and taking back the city in a resounding assault. It is not just pride that guides him - a lengthy siege would attract the attention of Junaid Khan and Madamin Bek, who watch with opportunistic eyes on our borders, and would additionally do much to provoke anger and disappoint in our Russian friends, as their interests in the city would be irreparably damaged by the starvation and destruction of a long-maintained encirclement.\n\nThere is no time now for regrets for what led us here - either our host will break the will of the rebels or be shattered upon the great bulwark of Samarkand. We have full faith in our commanders and our soldiers, and our spirits are buoyed by the knowledge that our cause is pious and true. It is the will of heaven that the wayward souls of our realm be brought back into the fold!"
 central_asian_crisis_events.449.d:9 "Madamin Bek, the President and Warlord of Turkestan, has started his greatest gamble yet - the conquest of Samarkand, the ancient jewel of Central Asia. His so-called Republic of Turkestan, little more than a den of snakes and bandits, tried their hand at conquering Samarkand nearly a decade ago, and has spent the years since their defeat seething. Recent insurrectionary action among the Kazakhs has also been linked to Turkestani efforts to undermine our administration and foment revolt, protected only by the thin veneer of plausible deniability. This most recent insult is the final straw.\n\nSamarkand is guarded by Emir Alim Khan, our closest ally in the region, but his position is shaky and he will not be able to hold out against the Turkestanis on his own. It would be politically unacceptable to allow the petty warlord of Tashkent to get away with destroying the greatest stronghold of Russian support in the region without a military response.\n\nWe began preparing for an intervention against Turkestan since they first rose up against us years ago, and it would not be difficult for us to move up our planning, starting the invasion prematurely. While some are concerned that without proper logistical support our attack may be ineffective, General-Fieldmarshal [RUS.GetArmyChief] has repeatedly demanded a green light for an immediate invasion."
 china_events.422.d:9 "With the unification of China and our professed mission to liberate Asia and the Pacific from imperialism, we have quickly become an inspiration for all those hoping to throw off the yoke of foreign colonialism. Many now proudly pattern their guerillas after MinGan and drill their soldiers with the Whampoa Spirit, and of course readily seek us out for aid and support. It is therefore no surprise that those who have overthrown their old masters have now sought to align with us, hoping to protect themselves from further attack and perhaps aid in the liberation of Asia. Still, it is worth doing our due diligence - while world revolution sounds nice on paper, the realities of geopolitics and overlapping nationalist claims should not be discounted in this new era for the continent."

Two years later, it began producing warships and in 1891 it even produced firearms like naval guns. Occupied in 1900 by the powers and returned to China two years later, the Dagu Shipyard remained prominent in the Warlord Era. It also was notable for producing European designed machine guns for the Ministry of Navy."

 league_collapse.1.d:9 "Assembled within Nanjing today were some of the League's most important and crucial men within the Southern Zhili Clique. Called to Nanjing by the magnanimous Smiling Tiger, such a scene is standard fare within the management of the League of Eight Provinces. Coinciding with President Cao Kun's Chinese New Year Speech, the League itself is no place for such frivolities such as those within Beijing. Adjourned within the Marshal's Palace, Sun Chuanfang commonly holds such meetings to discuss general League policy, to delegate assignments to League Governors, and to shore up his position within the provinces.\n\nAttending the meeting was that of Governor Qi Xieyuan of Jiangsu, perhaps Sun's greatest ally and simultaneously greatest rival within the League itself. Amassing controversies over the years since his re-adoption within the Southern Zhili, Qi is perhaps the most supportive of the malignant concessions policy within this informal council. On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, both at the conference table and in policy is that of Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, overseeing enterprises in Anhui province. Whilst a fairly recent adoption, Chen positions himself as an anti-concessionist, and openly manoeuvres himself in opposition to Qi.\n\nOf course other Governors were present, such as the brutal Governor Zhou Yinren of Fujian, taking rare leave from his position enacting the encirclement campaigns against the MinGan Insurgency. Similarly, Governor Deng Ruzhuo of Jiangxi, and that of the much derided Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang. Ominously, following through with their boycott of the Zhili, Governors Chen Jiongming, Lu Rongting and Zhao Hengti have scant sent any form of representation, not even a telegram indicating their absence.\n\nNo matter, this is a new prosperous year in the League. Albeit Governors Chen Yi, Qi Xieyuan and Chen Tiaoyuan were clearly uneasy with the presence of the League Marshal's closest confidants, that of Xie Hongxun, Meng Zhaoyue and Li Baozhang. Perhaps attempting to sniff out rats within the Governorship, as Sun's reputation of hyper vigilance has resulted in his most closest associates being friends, enemies, and enemies pretending to be friends."
 league_collapse.4.d:9 "Unsurprisingly, the wildly publicised consolidation of the Central China Railway under AOG management, and the ensuing media hurricane proliferated by Chen Tiaoyuan and the Anti-Concessionist movement has wrought widespread criticism. With intellectuals from the Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, National salvation Federation, Young China Party and even the Endeavour Society decrying the League Marshal and Governor Qi as sell-outs, traitors, unscrupulous traitors. Their ever so eloquent words are printed in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Chinese Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. Even worse, it would appear the truth has been snuffed out by the people's furiosity.\n\nLumped in with the absolute wretch of Governor Qi, Sun Chuanfang has received condemnation from the likes of the Lower Yangtze Merchant Association, and even half-heartedly from his friends within the Jingxing Society. With news spreading rapidly by word of mouth, it has grown into a furious tide of outrage, perhaps even fantastical to behold. The usually capable and adept Smiling Tiger has finally been caught.\n\nOld Wives' tales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League Marshal's pockets in the process. The public, naturally, has reacted with predictable furiosity, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including within the foreign settlements.\n\nWithin Sun's domain however, lies a comparatively broken man. For all he had done, was this the collapse of his empire? Couldn't be, he was better than this. Surely? Betrayed not only by the peasantry he paternally cared for, but simultaneously by the men of words he respected. Of course he can't sit idly by! The Smiling Tiger has endured far worse, and his ambitions are so much more than this. Despite this, even his closest confidants such as Xie Hongxun and Liu Zongji can see the wear and tear on the legendary Marshal."
 league_collapse.5.d:9 "Roused from a restless slumber, the League Marshal was once again intruded upon by his ever dutiful intelligence staff. Having maintained tabs on the rapidly developing events as of recent, a far more troubling and startling scene has begun to paint itself. Ushered to his desk and handed a series of telegrams, illuminated by the morning dawn, a disturbing narrative unfolded.\n\nBeginning with assaults on prominent German citizens and businessmen, rapidly developing to becoming virtually indiscriminate, attacks on foreigners emboldened by so-called \"patriotic\" citizens have begun to spawn within the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi and Anhui. Worse still, the popular sentiment and hunger for blood has resulted in such actions spreading like wildfire, practically seizing whole counties in fury.\n\nIn response, the German consulate in Nanjing has advised the Kaiser's subjects to arm themselves, with other European governments advising similarly. Implementing warnings that foreigners should only travel when necessary, it would appear even the League Marshal's much loathed allies are beginning to turn on him.\n\nThe impact of these attacks overall on business and investment remains to be seen, but recent history suggests the Shanghai Stock Exchange will not remain unaffected. His enlightened governance, besieged on all sides. Clouds are gathering over Nanjing..."
 league_collapse.7.d:9 "Further disturbing news has rang out within the League's provincial territories. It would appear that a series of explosions have rocked several stations and rail lines slated to become part of the Central China Railway, with one bomb shredding a train car in a crowded station at Hangzhou, leaving dozens killed and injured. With such news most vividly shaking civil servants, bureaucrats and governors alike, the deaths and delays leave many families bereaved. Pragmatically however, such blatant acts of anarchical destruction have also left much of the transportation sector to a standstill in many areas, acting as a detriment to Marshal Sun's rapid deployment of additional forces attempting to quell the growing unrest, and put down Governors Chen and Qi.\n\nBlame for the attacks has been levelled against various targets, with Sun's intelligence officers unable to make heads or tails of the chaotic scenery. Local bandits, looking to cause chaos to pillage undisturbed? The Kuomintang, hoping to set the stage for some greater uprising? Governor Qi, or Chen, hoping to prevent retribution from Nanjing? Or even the Japanese, aiming to sow the seeds of dissent further. Some especially conspiracy-minded individuals have suggested German involvement, who they posit are targeting their own possessions to set the stage for an intervention."
 league_collapse.8.d:9 "It seems as if every new day brings bad news, the Year of the Rat is already proving to be an uncontrollable calamity. Furthermore troubling reports have reached the Marshal's Palace from both Xuzhou and Quanzhou. Within the MinGan Insurgent Zone, it would appear Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army guerrillas have staged a series of increasingly bold raids, striking around the inland cities of Yongding and Longyan. Governor Zhou Yinren has historically long struggled to assert control over his mountainous province, with his actual feasible control often limited to the coast and the larger inland cities.\n\nNow with the NRA's increasing tenacity and developing boldness, Zhou's iron grasp has grown all the more tenuous. Meanwhile within the northern border of Jiangsu, Governor Qi has, rather unusually, sent reports of increased agitation by rural bandits, and apparently the seizure of villages by these clans. Evidently not a fool, Marshal Sun is all too familiar with Qi's charades with so-called \"bandit clans\", which are in reality his own soldiers. A point of long-standing frustration and contention between the Governor and Marshal, their renewed involvement may very well be encouraging the rising unrest.\n\nHowever prudent, Marshal Sun has motioned to dispatch a series of divisions that were aiding in maintaining order in Jiangxi and Fujian to move northwards, eyeing up the odds and preferring that the more valuable Jiangsu remain under the iron boot. Some within his inner circle however, float the idea that the Smiling Tiger is tightening the noose further on Governors Chen and Qi."
 league_collapse.9.d:9 "Despite our pretences and hand waving, the ever persistent Jade Marshal and King of Baoding have sent a flurry of inquisitive telegrams to Nanjing. The ostensible rulers of the country ever since the Third ZhiFeng War, Marshal Wu Peifu and President Cao Kun carry exorbitant influence, even on the League Marshal. Despite their contention, the nascent arms race between Smiling Tiger and Jade Marshal, and the multi-polar world of the Northern and Southern Zhili, Wu Peifu is after all, still Sun's mentor, and that carries an unshakeable bond. Similarly those within Sun's inner-circle fear Wu's military skill, Cao's political capabilities, and the full might of the Northern Zhili crashing down upon them.\n\nThe message requests a detailed report about the current chaotic situation unfolding within the Southeastern territories. Eloquent, adamant and demanding, the telegram is clearly worded with the intent to force the League Marshal to admit to some weakness or hardship, as an excuse for the Central army to move in and \"re-establish control\". Repeatedly attempting to wrangle, control and extend its influence within the south following the formation of the League in 1928, their efforts have been brilliantly deflected by Sun.\n\nEver a capable statesman, Sun's response must be measured, careful, considerate of all quantities that he must balance. Mentor and protégé, North and South, and the stability of his realm contrasted with the stability of the nation. Collaborating with his close and charismatic advisor Wei Daofeng, the Marshal wrote..."
 league_collapse.11.d:9 "Following up on his demand, Governor Chen has publicised his official secession without a response from the League Marshal. Citing the recent incident at Wuhu, his demand transformed into an ultimatum calling for the complete and utter withdrawal of all non-provincial forces from Anhui province, as well as the immediate hand-over of those officers responsible for the Wuhu Incident. Rather humiliatingly Chen has assured the League Marshal that his own soldiers will continue to \"quell the spreading unrest and disorder\", as if he's done any of that in the first place.\n\nRefusing further cooperation with League authorities, he has furthermore denounced the creation of the Central China Railway, blaming it for \"pushing patriotic citizens to the edge of despair\". Having long been a thorn in our side, it would appear that \"The Fool\" has shown his hand. Aiding and spurning the inferno of popular outcry and outrage against the League and its Marshal, it has become evidently clear that Chen was merely grandstanding for a casus belli to officiate his independence from the Smiling Tiger's grasp.\n\nUnder any normal circumstances, this behaviour would be met with immediate, swift, and brutal retribution. Yet Governor Chen's stance, ties to the anti-concessionists and the media campaign turning him into some sort of nationalist hero has resulted in apprehension from the League Marshal. Decisive action now could very well serve to further divide the now fragile League. Not one to take such intolerable actions sitting down however, League Marshal Sun has formally requested that his most loyal generals Xie Hongxun, Liu Zongji, Meng Zhaoyue and Ma Yuren prepare their soldiers for a clash with the Anhui Army."
 league_collapse.15.d:9 "\"To the eminent President Cao Kun, and Imperial Minister Wu Peifu,\n\nI, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan, humbly ask for extrajudicial funding for my troops. As outlined in the constitution of our great nation, it is the responsibility of the national government to provide funds to provincial governors to suppress unrest. With the situation of League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang in Nanjing unclear, I have taken the responsibility of protecting the province of Anhui against bandits and leftist agitators.\"\n\nDelivered in the form of a telegram to Cao Kun and forwarded to Wu Peifu this morning, the tone surprised both men in its boldness, appearing to proposition the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding by holding them to the merits of the constituion. Appearing to have restored order to his province, Chen is clearly gambling for support from the Central Government in order to expand beyond Anhui.\n\nFaced with a rather difficult choice, Chen could potentially remove a chess piece from the board, wipping it clean with a man beholden to his support, as opposed to the rather unyieldy League. However with the baggage of a firm anti-concessionist following, Wu and Cao's support could see the long-term alienation of Germany, something Cao has delicately cultivated for years. At the same time, standing with the anti-concessionists would allow Wu and Cao to once again bend to the opinion of the popular masses, riding the wave of support akin to 1922."
 league_collapse.18.d:9 "In light of the Central Government's attempts to coax and welcome Governor Chen into the Zhili fold, through diplomatic manoeuvring on Cao's front, financial aid from Wang Kemin's banks and military aid from the Jade Marshal, it would appear that Governor Chen has rebuffed our attempts to parley. Growing increasingly distant and out of our reach in our recent contacts.\n\nOne of our own border guards discovered refugees arriving in our lands, carrying pamphlets from the infamous Japanese paramilitary Black Dragon Society. Now in the vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders, it would appear further disturbing impressions are upon us. Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang Province, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by other refugees. Our intelligence operatives highly suspect that the Governor is attempting to not only betray President Cao, Marshal Wu and the Emperor, but also that of the Chinese nation itself by establishing contacts with Japan's intelligence ring."
 league_collapse.24.t2:9 "Chen Tiaoyuan Reconsiders His Position"
 league_collapse.24.d2:9 "Despite all pretence to cast Governor Chen to the dogs, it would appear that the Zhili's swift backtracking has saved it from the worst of Fengtian's intrigues within the League. Either swayed by Wu's poignant words, the materiel and funding, or out of almost a full decade of previous support and backing, Governor Chen has granted the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding a green light for a continued cooperative arrangement.\n\nOn the back of this, Zhang Zhitan has informed Luoyang that Dongbei advisors and Japanese officers have already begun to be shuttled out of Anhui, or otherwise apprehended, reinforcing Chen's re-alignment with his true masters."
 league_collapse.24.b:9 "Let's see how the gamble plays out."
 league_collapse.25.d1:9 "With the refusal of Governor Chen's telegram, it would appear that the ambitious, opportunistic Qi Xieyuan has caught wind of the rebuttal. All but usurping Sun Chuanfang's role within the League, Qi has proclaimed himself to be the new \"League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces\", despite Sun having not officially been declared dead to the public.\n\nAddressing a flowery letter to both Cao and Wu, he has directly requested aid in suppressing what he has deemed to be \"a minor rebellion in Anhui province\", despite our intelligence and Chen's telegram clearly indicating otherwise. Insisting that since we are the rightful authority in the Central Government, it is \"only proper conduct that we support the rightful Marshal of the League\".\n\nThe pompous tone has left Wu and Cao suspicious of Qi's request, considering that some sort of upstart warlord who has already caused trouble in 1924 would make demands of them. Even worse Qi could theoretically easily crush Anhui and the Kuomintang Uprising with German Aid alone. However Cao and his advisors, Gao Lingwei among them, still suggests that a strong League and a strong relationship with Germany is the way forward for progress."

 league_collapse.25.c:9 "The die is already cast."
 league_collapse.50.d:9 "Thoroughly enwrapped within the global German economic powerhouse since their intervention in 1927, and the following negotiations between President Cao Kun and German Emissaries, the League of Eight Provinces would actually opt to maintain course with the Central Government in relation to the German issue. A patriot and anti-concessionist, League Marshal Sun would only fold to the German bulwark after 1928. As following a build up of tensions between the North and South Zhili, the Smiling Tiger would reach his zenith following the creation of the League of Eight Provinces in 1928, and its further expansion into Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan the following year. Flouting disarmament directives from Beijing, Sun would instead increase the size of his army.\n\nThis would of course, promote a curious dilemma for the League Marshal. Strongly against extensive taxes on the peasantry, he would be backed into a relative corner. Qi Xieyuan and Li Linsi, who had both recently returned to China, would advise the League Marshal on his one sure-fire out of this predicament. Taking on significant loans backed by concessions to the Germans and Legations, he would receive the necessary funding to construct an army to rival that of the Jade Marshal's.\n\nFollowing on from his increased oppression of socialist rebels and democratic thinkers, political manoeuvres in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan would see the League further decline in strength. And so it would be, the anti-concessionist Sun further thrust into the arms of the Germans, much to his personal distaste.\n\nAnd although it began a world away, Black Monday's fallout has already cleaved through Chinese markets. The Shanghai Exchange plummeted before closing at numbers unseen since the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are already mobilising what they can to mitigate the damage. Fortunately, the average Chinese citizen, and the nation as a whole, are unlikely to feel any immediate impact. But the AOG, already staggering under an extensive retaliatory boycott faces dire financial circumstances.\n\nIts clerks have already issued notice that it may be unable to pay the usual rents for its various concessions within the League provinces, and that the final payment promised for the ZheGan Railway has been \"indefinitely postponed\". The already despondent Marshal has been sent further into the chasm of darkness, as without this planned revenue, vast swathes of budget cuts are necessary to stay afloat. News even abounds that Governor Chen has begun mobilising forces directed at Nanjing..."
 league_collapse.53.d:9 "Rushing to his home in the middle of the night, Wu Peifu was awoken by his secretary, Bai Jianwu, and his Chief of Staff, Zhang Qihuang, rousing the Jade Marshal from a restless slumber. Ushering Wu towards his desk, the duo slid an emergency telegram report in front of the Marshal, for his eyes only. Enquiring as to if President Cao has seen the same telegram, he learned that Wang Yujia and Liu Menggeng are already explaining the situation to the President. Glancing his eyes over the confidential telegram sheet, awe washing over his face, it read:\n\n'Sun Chuanfang shot 8:55 AM STOP\nPerpetrator unknown STOP\nIn coma STOP\nUnlikely to wake STOP\nRiots widespread STOP\nFleeing with gold and documents STOP'\n\nTwo hours later, Luoyang became a frenzied hub of activity. Documents concerning Sun's more salacious dealings with Beijing burnt in furnaces, while groups of Jinbao and Luoyang Zhili members argue over the Smiling Tiger's connections. In an unprecedented move, Cao Kun has invited several Manchu nobles, notably the Emperor's brother Pujie, to be present for the drafting of some form of unified statement in response to the assassination, perhaps desiring a united front in these troubling times.\n\nBeyond it all, the Jade Marshal can't help but feel sorrow for the fate that has befallen Sun Chuanfang. His protégé, his original successor, for all they shared in ideology and memory, to be sullied like this?"

 league_collapse.59.d:9 "Still lacking in any legitimate central authority, the League has been in an utter death spiral of its disparate parts. Left to fend for themselves without central management from Nanjing, reports rage about the wild situation within Fujian, Jiangxi, the amassing of even more soldiers within Anhui province, the untenable situation within Shandong, and all other matters of chaos. Indirectly acting in the role of the League Marshal following Sun's coma, Governor Qi of Jiangsu has attempted his best efforts to stem the League's rapid bleeding. Unable to command other Governors due to lacking in authority, his actions have been blunted.\n\nMeeting behind closed doors within the relative safety of the Marshal's Palace, Governor Qi had assembled the military men of Ma Yuren, Xie Hongxun, Zheng Junyan, Meng Zhaoyue, Wang Haoji, Zhou Fengqi, Li Baozhang and Liu Zongji. Closely behind are the intellectuals and bureaucrats of Tang Erhe, Li Linsi, Ding Wenjiang, Wei Daofeng, Yang Wenkai, and of course Qi's right-hand man Tian Wenbing. Having gathered all of the most important, and available, figures within the League into one meeting chamber, the same one the Governors had all met in not so long ago, few had any pretences of what Governor Qi was about to propose.\n\nDrafting a formal petition to those assembled, in lieu of any formal succession, to declare Qi as acting League Marshal, the Governor of Jiangsu has finally shown his hand. Immediately chaos ruptured within the room, with Generals Xie Hongxun, Li Baozhang and Meng Zhaoyue accusing Qi of masterminding Sun's assassination attempt. Similarly Yang Wenkai brought forth the fact that the culprit carried with her a German pistol. Turning his head to Tian, Qi's subordinate nodded, as he disappeared from the chamber for a brief moment. Upon his swift return, he was flanked by a series of Chinese soldiers sporting German weaponry and equipment.\n\nEmerging from the meeting to declare himself acting League Marshal, Qi Xieyuan has broadcasted his intentions to restore order to the fractured League. Already his forces have begun asserting control over Nanjing's arsenal, military headquarters, and major thoroughfares, broadcasting his ascension by megaphone and clearing the streets with enfilades of rifle fire. Cities along much of the Lower Yangtze have already begun declaring for Qi, with Governors Deng and Zhou going along with it. Albeit Governor Chen Yi has wavered on declaring support, with Chen Jiongming, Lu Rongting and Zhao Hengti refusing to acknowledge the news."
 league_collapse.62.d:9 "Listening to Cao Kun's request and intervening in the League War on behalf of the League itself, many within the assembly and inner Zhili circles were all the more aware that such a choice was bound to be an unpopular one. With the broad populace roused up by the anti-concessionist intellectuals, Chen Tiaoyuan's defiance, and the anti-imperialist sentiments that have remained a continuous undercurrent for years, it was nonetheless decided that the storm can be weathered to preserve the special relationship with Germany.\n\nGranted the entirely unenviable job of delivering the news of their intervention to the Assembly, Cao rather reluctantly called forth an Assembly meeting to officiate the intervention on behalf of the League. With Minister Gao Lingwei and Minister Wang Kemin standing with him, Cao began: \"My dear cherished friends, I gathered all of you here today to convey to you rather important new concerning the Government's decision in regards to the unrest in the South\". The assembly perking up with bated breath, he continued. \"Marshal Wu, his command staff and the cabinet have all elected to support League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan in his struggles against the rebellious province of Anhui and its traitorous Governor Chen Tiaoyuan. With our limited intervention marching south as we speak, it is expected that a quick, decisive and total vict-\".\n\nCao would cease his speech as members of the Young China Party stood up and silently started to march out of the hall. Soon after, they were followed by members of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, the Independents and even some members of the Zongshe Party. Appearing sombre, Cao would glance at the few remaining Harmony Association and Prosperity League members remaining within the Assembly. Stunned, Cao put down his papers."
 league_collapse.63.d:9 "Exiting the Assembly Hall carrying himself in a mixture of fury and consternation, the President would bark orders at his assistants and Minister Gao, clearly aiming to find methods in which he can reprimand the protesting politicians of the Assembly. Nonetheless, as he exited the hall he would be swarmed by reporters, and members of the Prosperity League.\n\nQuick to congratulate the President, they produced various luxuries from the German Economic World. Rhenish Wine, Cuban Cigars, and other foreign delicacies were offered to Cao and his assemblymen. Yet met with distant glances and even scorn, few participate in their \"Prosperous\" goodwill.\n\nIn contrast of the usual dour-faced Manchu nobles who would normally greet the President outside of the building, German bureaucrats and representatives from the Southern Zhili kleptocracy welcomed the President with open arms, dressed in the latest Berlin finery and offering even more exorbitant gifts to Harmony Association lawmakers, the likes of Wang Chengbin and Cao's faction within the military would quickly whisk the President away, allowing him to escape the embarrassment."

With his forces cemented around Hangzhou a stable corridor south to Fujian and Jiangxi has been preserved, with Governor Deng and Governor Zhou no doubt breathing sighs of relief.\n\nAlthough we should still remain vigilant, as the entrance of Zhejiang into the conflict, alongside the regrouping of the Zhejiang Clique, leaves the province susceptible to advances from the Kuomintang, Zhejiang or Anhui armies."
 league_collapse_flavour.5.d:9 "With widespread unrest sweeping the League of Eight Provinces, Governor Li Jichen of Henan and Xiao Yaonan of Hubei have telegrammed to President Cao and Marshal Wu, informing them both of increasing numbers of refugees flooding into their provinces, requesting any possible governmental response or assistance. Although it initially started as a trickled, over the course of the last few days the flow has dramatically increased, with whole families fleeing the explosive tornado of violence and banditry.\n\nSending further followup telegrams there afterwards, the Governors have indicated to the Cabinet that after sending their men to organise and interview the refugees, it would turn out that the authority within the League provinces has collapsed far more than what was previously believed. Furthermore, they have requested from Beijing additional food and supplies to handle all of the refugees. Marred by inefficiencies in bureaucracy, provincial government and insufficient finances, any support that the Cabinet deigns to provide would be of great cost, even if it is the humane course of action."
 league_collapse_flavour.9.d:9 "Shadows have long loomed large over the League Marshal's chambers. Almost delicately, there he lay, Sun Chuanfang, once the third most powerful man in the whole nation, reduced to nothing more than dead weight. At least, that's what his detractors think. To others, to his thousand friends, their sadness is deep, their grief everlasting, and the memories permeable. Visited frequently by his closest associates, his friends, and of course his own children. Weeping rivers of sorrow, they could only hope for Sun's recovery, as German doctors worked around the clock to resuscitate the Tiger, so he could bear his fangs once more.\n\nIn the midst of the night of Nanjing, amongst the echoing firefights, the explosions, the yelling, only a singular figure sat in the room with League Marshal Sun. Playing with a lighter, dressed in the shadows of the room, Acting League Marshal Qi Xieyuan watched over Sun Chuanfang's comatose body. The German doctors of course, were under his retinue. He was the one sustaining Sun's timid grasp on life. And he could so easily snuff it out, like the flame of his lighter.\n\nFlicking his lighter, igniting it, and closing it again. Qi repeated this motion for what felt like hours. Much toyed with the mind of the General. Sun and Qi, they were comrades, truly. Both born of the Southern Zhili, having fought in the Southeast for a decade. Yet Qi never forgave Sun for his inaction in 1925. When Qi needed help most as Governor of Zhejiang, he desperately pleaded with Sun, Governor of Fujian, for help. Together they could've withstood the onslaught of Lu Yongxiang and Zhang Zongchang. And yet, Sun instead built up for a year, instead of immediately counter-attacking.\n\nSuch betrayal, it had cost Qi dearly! Struggling to make his comeback, he would be \"graciously\" accepted by Sun after the formation of the League. Working his magic, Qi did the dirty work for Sun, and now here they are. The helpless Sun, and the all-powerful Qi. Who could stop him? Pulling the plug?\n\nReports flooded in the next morning. Sun Chuanfang finally succumbed to his wounds, having passed in the middle of the night. With the newspapers drafting an eulogy remembering him in a mixed nature, praising his \"authenticity\", patriotism but decrying his brutality. A funeral will reportedly take place once order is restored to the League. Although Sun's demise made the front page of morning headlines, it was surrounded by reports of troop movements, student massacres, and the utter collapse of his empire."

[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the Exiles' forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Parisians looked on, the Exiles' army paraded through the Champs-Elysées and towards the Eiffel Tower. This festive atmosphere eventually devolved into vicious urban combat, however, with [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the dead of the night and Exile forces easily ploughing through inefficient barricades in the large Parisian avenues."
 city_capture.283.d:9 "Reports from the old city of Algiers, capital of the French government in exile since 1920, tell us of its fall to the advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops. After progressing slowly although efficiently through the great colonial avenues near the coast, [FROM.GetAdjective] forces met heavier resistance when leaving the sight of the bay in the more popular districts of Algiers' heights.\n\nFierce fights have taken place between [FROM.GetAdjective] and [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers, especially in the popular European district of Bab-El-Oued and in the famous Notre-Dame-D'Afrique Basilica, but finally at dawn most of the city had fallen and the last pockets of resistance were getting eliminated in the Casbah. The sun rising on the bay unveiled a city under a new protector."

 NFA_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:9 "The Char de Bataille Peugeot Modèle 1939 is an upgraded compound of the CMER-35 and the CRP-37S. Developed by Peugeot in preparation for the return to France, the CBP-39 is armed with a 75mm gun and good armour. However, the CBP-39 does not have a special niche, and it is mainly used to fill holes in the tactical and strategic plans of the French command."
 NFA_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:9 "The CdC G1-R is a 20-ton replacing for the CMER-35. The CdC G1-R is one of the most advanced French tanks, providing good armament and mobility and suitable for multiple roles. Armed with 75mm gun and featuring improved protection, the tank initially suffered from low reliability, but after several changes in the specifications, the CdC G1-R was adopted in service. Considering as multi-role tank, the CdC G1-R have several innovative parts such as a gun stabilisation and semi-automatic loading systems and an optical rangefinder."

 HND_infantry_equipment_0_desc:9 "The Ishapore Rifle Factory was founded in 1904 and began producing the venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. However, the loss of much of British India after the British Revolution also meant the loss of the Ishapore factory, one of the only two factories producing the SMLE outside of Britain. Many guns produced prior to the revolution still however remain in service, and more still are produced in and surrounding the former lands of the Raj."

 PRF_infantry_equipment_0_desc:9 "The Ishapore Rifle Factory was founded in 1904 and began producing the venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. However, the loss of much of British India after the British Revolution also meant the loss of the Ishapore factory, one of the only two factories producing the SMLE outside of Britain. Many guns produced prior to the revolution still however remain in service, and more still are produced in and surrounding the former lands of the Raj."

 pre_war_events.1.d:9 "5 years ago today the workers of Geneva began a major industrial action, demanding social and economic reforms, which threatened to spread to the rest of French-speaking western Switzerland (known as the Romandie).\n\n Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandie and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal.\n\nEncouraged by recent developments in France the radical left has begun to agitate once more and is planning on standing Socialist candidates in the upcoming local elections. However the social democrats, traditionally very strong in the Romandie have devised a reform package in conjunction with the trade unions, the \"Peace of Work\" agreement, which involves a number of policies regarding wage increases, shift times and so on. One of the key points is to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures which have taken place recently.\n\nThe social democratic candidates are relying on this programme to be re-elected and hopefully defuse the stand-off between the radical left and the conservative dominated Federal government in Bern."
 pre_war_events.3.d:9 "Backed by the conservative federal government and the majority of the German-speaking cantons, the Swiss employer's organisations have refused to sign the so-called \"Peace of Work\" agreement proposed by the social-democrats to put an end to the massive lockouts happening in the watch manufactories.\n\nWhile the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neuchâtel which are now calling for ambitious reforms."
 pre_war_events.5.d:9 "While the newly elected Socialist governments in Romandie have stepped into office, Federal intelligence services are reporting that French agents have crossed the border to advise the Romand leftists whilst a partial mobilisation of French border units near Geneva is also said to be under way.\n\nThe situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandie seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandie by the Federal army. But with the violence in Haute-Savoie agitating the French, the risk of triggering an armed response is high, though, and we cannot be sure of the Reichspakt's support..."
 pre_war_events.6.d:9 "The Federal Council, backed up by local French-speaking conservatives, has ordered \"sure\" (i.e. German-speaking) Federal Army units to enter Romand cantons to introduce martial law. Socialist leaders, as well as many workers and Syndicalist sympathisers, have been arrested and provisional local governments are being set up under Federal supervision. In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for armed resistance against Federal rule and the return of Haute-Savoie to French hands.\n\nDespite the repression, the Romandie and now Haute-Savoie are now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demobilised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura Mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent."
 pre_war_events.7.d:9 "The bourgeois Swiss government has shown its true face and has toppled the democratically elected Socialist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and other French-speaking cantons! As if that were not enough, now too they beat and bloody Frenchmen on our own soil in Savoie! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country.\n\nThey have just set up a Syndicalist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for the restoration of properly elected officials and the prosecution of the current federal government. Since none of the reactionary Powers seem to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and both empower Syndicalist movements in our neighbour and see the return of our rightful territory."
 pre_war_events.8.d:9 "The French have demanded the return of the province of Haute-Savoie. They have fabricated claims of White Terror perpetuated by the Swiss Federation and Syndicalist leaders across Switzerland are getting involved.\n\nWe can not guarantee that we will have German support if we stand up to these Syndicalist bastards."
 pre_war_events.9.d:9 "The Commune of France, in its mad quest for power, is demanding the province of Haute-Savoie from Switzerland. This latest diplomatic crisis threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale.\n\nShall we threaten the French with war or will Switzerland stand alone?"
 pre_war_events.10.d:9 "Our attempt to protect our independence and territorial integrity against the outrageous French claims with German mediation ended in failure.\n\nWe are now forced to find an alternative solution to this crisis."
 pre_war_events.11.d:9 "The German Empire has sent an ultimatum to Paris.\n\nWe are to cease our diplomatic and undercover activities aimed against the territorial integrity of Switzerland or face the might of the German army."
 pre_war_events.12.d:9 "After our diplomatic message was received by Paris they quickly ceased all diplomatic and undercover activities aimed against the territorial integrity of Switzerland.\n\nWe have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression and we will protect any nation under threat from these revolutionaries!"
 pre_war_events.13.d:9 "The French have ignored our diplomatic efforts to maintain the peace in Europe and are continuing their destabilisation efforts against Switzerland.\n\nThe French have made their intentions clear, we cannot let the Swiss people stand alone!"

 pre_war_events.18.d:9 "The Commune of France and the Swiss Federation have declined all other options and the war has begun.\n\nWhile the Swiss have not asked for our help, this would give us an opportunity to reunite the Italian Peninsula!"
 pre_war_events.19.d:9 "France has gone to war with the neutral Swiss Federation over the Haute-Savoie Province, a province with a majority of Swiss French. France has used fabricated stories of 'White Terror' in Annecy and Romandie as a pretext for their invasion.\n\nNow we must decide if Switzerland is a lost cause or if we are going to intervene on behalf of the Federation."
 pre_war_events.21.d:9 "The uneasy truce observed between the Federal government and the Socialist-controlled local councils in French-speaking cantons has come to an end. After several clashes between German-speaking soldiers in training and Geneva policemen, the Romand socialist leaders, pressed by the worker's militias, have proclaimed secession from Switzerland and the constitution of a so-called \"Romand Socialist Federation\".\n\nAccording to intelligence reports, the French and the secessionists have engaged in talks about an union between the Romand cantons and the Commune of France. The Federation, conveniently, has also called for the region of Haute-Savoie to be ceded back to France."
 pre_war_events.22.d:9 "Despite the repression conducted by Federal Army troops and loyal Romands, Socialist militias, reportedly using French-made heavy weapons and equipment, are on the offensive in almost all of the Romandie and Haute-Savoie. Main lines of communication with the rest of Switzerland may fall under secessionist control, as well as most of the region's infrastructure.\n\nGeneva's State Council is besieged by pro-French militias and exiled Socialists are said to have returned from France to form a new and unified Socialist government. It also seems that the Federal Army has no control over the Swiss-French border anymore."
 pre_war_events.22.b:9 "Their feeble attempts were crushed by the army!"
 pre_war_events.23.d:9 "The brave workers and peasants of the French-speaking Swiss cantons have won their fight against the reactionary forces of the Bern government! At the unanimous request of the newly establish Communes of Geneva and Romandie, the Comité de Salut Public has proclaimed their union with the Commune of France.\n\nWhile the local militias are being integrated in the Communal Army, French motorised units, supported by air forces, are heading towards the new border to prevent any retaliatory offensive from a revanchist Swiss government, and the government has retaken control of the Haute-Savoie region."
 pre_war_events.24.d:9 "The treacherous Socialist rebels in the Romandie and Haute-Savoie, who had been on the verge of being wiped out by our brave soldiers, have called the Commune of France for protection! Last night French troops supported by tanks and bombers entered Swiss territory up to Fribourg, while elite French mountain troops have stormed our defensive positions in the Alps and in the Jura Mountains.\n\nFrench state broadcasters have announced that the Romandie has been annexed to the Commune of France, all the while routed soldiers and refugees are arriving in Bern in the thousands. Our ambassador in Paris has been warned that any attempt to resist the Armée de la Commune would lead to massive bombings of Zurich, Basel and Bern and the total annihilation of Swiss military capacities."
 pre_war_events.25.d:9 "The Swiss Federal Army and its repugnant reactionary volunteer auxiliaries have defeated the heroic defenders of Socialist revolution in the Romandie and Haute-Savoie. As thousands stream across the border to seek asylum in France, French-speaking militiamen are executed after mock trials, while right-wing activists and bourgeois hunt down Socialists, Anarchists and Syndicalists, loot their homes and take gruesome revenge on their families. Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free not only Savoie but even the Romands from the clutches of Switzerland's bloodthirsty rulers.\n\nAs our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comité de Salut Public has informed Bern that should Haute-Savoie not be evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, and Romand political leaders reinstated to their positions, war would be inevitable."
 pre_war_events.36.d:9 "Our agents in Berlin and Strasbourg have informed us that an unprecedented concentration of German troops is planned in Alsace and Lorraine under the guise of 'military exercise'. Such an aggressive move from the German autocracy, at a time when Lorrains are desperately fighting for their freedom, is nothing more that a desperate attempt to test our resolution.\n\nHowever, such a plan is bound to backfire: to prevent further German provocations, partial mobilisation of the Communal army divisions in eastern regions has been ordered and a show of force may be performed in Franche-Comté, near the Alsatian border, where newly-created armoured regiments are to exercise in combined operations with infantry divisions and air support."
 pre_war_events.37.d:9 "It now seems that the Lorraine crisis can not be resolved unless the French are humbled once again, and the time has come for Germany again to show its force. In this regard, at the request of the Kaiser, his grandson and future Kronprinz Prince Wilhelm von Preußen will attend the military exercise organised in Alsace-Lorraine under the name \"Tüchtiger Bogenschütze\" (the name was chosen because new long-range artillery prototypes from Krupp factories are to be tested in real conditions during the exercise), which will be the largest concentration of troops since the Weltkrieg.\n\nNo less than eight divisions will be deployed near the French border, where fortifications have been fully manned. Three air regiments and armoured units will also take part in the operations, which will be followed by many European military attachés. Ready to march on Paris, these troops will surely make the Commune back down in terror!"
 pre_war_events.38.d:9 "German sabre-rattling and an ever worsening situation in Lorraine have convinced the Comité de Salut Public to give in to the General Staff's request for a wide-scale military exercise at the border that will prove the uncompromising resolution of the Commune to both friends and foes! The high-ranking officers have decided in favour of a major combined arms exercise in northern Franche-Comté, which will be named \"Opération Kléber\".\n\nFour infantry divisions and two motorised infantry divisions, with their divisional artillery units, will face the Germans near Belfort, while bomber and fighter wings will train in coordination with an armoured division equipped with the newest medium and heavy tanks. Impressed by our modern and unstoppable military force, the Kaiser and his minions will have no choice but to retreat behind the Voges Mountains!"
 pre_war_events.39.d:9 "At 6 AM this morning, a so-called \"military exercise\" organised by the German Army has proved to be nothing more that a treacherous act of aggression against the Commune! At least two artillery batteries have opened fire across the border and have shelled Avricourt, a small and undefended village near Nancy. Twelve buildings have been destroyed and 26 people, mostly women and children, have been slaughtered in this cowardly attack.\n\nThe survivors are being evacuated as border troops, reinforced with longe-range artillery, are now facing the murderous German units. An emergency session is being held at the Bourse Générale du Travail, while the Chief of Staff has just come back with his aides from Besançon to Paris to consider the most appropriate response to such a despicable attack."
 pre_war_events.40.d:9 "The bloodthirsty French have thrown their mask away and are revealing their intention to attack Elsaß-Lothringen! At 0630, a platoon of French tanks crossed the border east of Metz and opened fire against one of our border outposts near Elfringen.\n\nThe local patrol courageously fought back and drove off the invaders, but over a dozen had been killed or wounded by the end of the incident. Prince Wilhelm, who was present in the region, has been called back to Berlin and is to report the situation to the Kaiser as soon as possible, while the Cabinet is now evaluating the crisis and is discussing the best option to answer this odious crime."
 pre_war_events.41.d:9 "An unfortunate incident has just occurred during a military exercise in progress in Elsaß-Lothingen. Two of our new long-range artillery batteries, manned by young recruits, have mistakenly shelled a small French village by the name of Avricourt due to poor fire range evaluation. According to the Red French broadcast, several locals would have been killed by this accidental shelling.\n\nMilitary police is currently interrogating the officer and NCO's in charge, but the French, shamelessly taking advantage of the situation, have issued an inflammatory statement demanding official apologies from the Kaiser and Cabinet and threatening Germany of \"unpredictable consequences\" if we refuse to comply."
 pre_war_events.42.d:9 "A regrettable episode has just taken place at the German border during one of our combined military exercises currently organised around Sarrebourg. A tank platoon, misguided by faulty map directions, apparently drove a little too close to the border. The crew, however, insisted that they were still on the French side when the trigger-happy German border-guards open fired on them. Regardless, a firefight broke out near a small Lorraine village named Elfringen and there were casualties on both sides.\n\nMilitary intelligence officers have been immediately sent on the spot to investigate and the commanding lieutenant has been put under preventative arrest. However, the warmongering Germans are outrageously taking advantage of this incident. The Comité de Salut Public has just received an insulting ultimatum from Berlin, demanding an official apology and the ending of our military exercise with the threat of \"extremely severe consequences\" if we don't comply."
 pre_war_events.43.d:9 "Germany has been impressed by our uncompromising stance and has admitted its responsibility in the infamous Avricourt massacre! After our ambassador in the Hague has informally met a plenipotentiary sent by the Chancellor, Berlin has issued a formal apology statement from the Kaiser and has withdrawn some troops from Lorraine, which our recon forces have confirmed. Our Foreign minister, as well as our allies from the Internationale, have asked the Comité de Salut Public to accept this apology.\n\nHowever, such a decision would certainly disappoint a now revengeful and bellicist French public opinion; more importantly, during an extremely tense secret meeting with the CSP, the General Staff has warned that, should the German apology be accepted without further compensations, the Army would not yield to the civil power's decisions without internal dissent and attempts to mutiny."
 pre_war_events.44.d:9 "As expected from the imperialists, Germany has not only refused to apologise for its crimes, but has called for general mobilisation! Active and Landwehr divisions are gathering between Wallonia and Switzerland, while our fighters have been engaged in an isolated dogfight with German planes above Sedan and sporadic gunfire exchanges are reported all along the Lorraine border.\n\nWar seems now imminent: however, moderate members of the Bourse Générale du Travail are worrying about our level of operational preparedness and have declared that they would vote in favour of a temporary retreat, in order to wait for new tank and bomber models that should be delivered in a few months now. On the other hand, top ranking military officers consider that war is unavoidable and stress the fact that victory can be achieved now with a swift offensive against the heart of the Reich, before Germany can fully use its industrial power."
 pre_war_events.45.d:9 "After our Ambassador in Mexico had been informed by the French diplomatic mission that our ultimatum would be answered very soon, the Communards have formally apologised for their shameful act of war in Elfringen and have withdrawn their troops from Nancy.\n\nThe Cabinet now wants to give priority to the Lorraine crisis and would be reportedly ready to accept this apology as long as the French military exercise is immediately cancelled, but is wary of the public opinion's reaction; the crown prince has incidentally expressed his wish to \"humble the Red murderers\" during an improvised press conference in Karlsruhe, and the Generalstab has advised against any sign of leniency that could be misunderstood by the French for a sign of weakness."
 pre_war_events.46.d:9 "It is now obvious that the Commune has planned to go at war with Germany, the so-called \"Avricourt massacre\" being nothing more than a convenient excuse! As general mobilisation has been ordered by the \"Comité de Salut Public\", our signal corps units in the West report that massive concentrations of troops, including armoured and motorised formations, have been deployed from Sedan to Montbéliard, while French fortifications near the Flemish border seem to have been significantly reinforced.\n\nAt least one French plane has been shot down above German territory, and a few skirmishes have opposed our soldiers to French units near the Lorraine border. War hawks within the Cabinet and the Kaiser's entourage, encouraged by massive nationalist meetings in all major cities, is eager to rally the troops for war and finish the French off for good. However, some military circles are less than enthusiast, warning that the modern, innovative, well-trained French army is nothing like its battered 1919 counterpart and should not be underestimated."
 pre_war_events.47.d:9 "Unsatisfied by our sincere apology after the Avricourt incident, the Commune, whose best divisions are now concentrating at our border, now pretends that the bombing of Avricourt, being a deliberate aggression in time of peace, must be compensated by Germany, and demands financial reparations to cover material as well as moral damage suffered by the victims and French public infrastructures.\n\nThe German people will not accept to give in to such endless and baseless claims; however, the military situation is deteriorating fast as French commando units have successfully crossed the border in at least four occasions, even if for a short time, and have made contact with French-speaking militants in Lorraine; so it might be wiser to agree to pay these reparations and ease the tension with the Commune."
 pre_war_events.48.d:9 "As gunfire exchanges and dogfights are increasingly frequent, diplomatic overtures have been made by the French to discuss a negotiated ending to the Lorraine crisis. Paris claims to be ready to demobilise its troops, save for the border guard units, and will end all support to French-speaking paramilitary formations in Lorraine in exchange of German demobilisation and retreat from the French border.\n\nAccepting this offer will give us the opportunity to restore order in Lorraine, and the crisis will end with a diplomatic victory for the Reich!"
 pre_war_events.49.d:9 "Despite our goodwill gesture, Germany now claims that the so-called \"Mass murder of Elfringen\" has caused heavy material damage to the whole area and that victims have to receive monetary compensations. The German cabinet has publicly demanded that the Commune pays reparations, both in gold and in various raw materials and industrial resources, so that Elfringen and its surroundings can be rebuilt at the French people's expenses.\n\nThis new claim has been met with fierce opposition from the public opinion and radical factions within both the Bourse Générale du Travail and the Army suggest that all negotiations with Germany should be terminated. But the military situation at the German border is undecided as several infantry units near Metz have suffered damage from German artillery gunfire, and our forces might be not in position to successfully engage the Kaiser's army for now..."
 pre_war_events.50.d:9 "Our air harassment and infiltration tactics have bore fruit and the German government has informed the chairman of the Comité de Salut Public that it was ready to negotiate a cease-fire, with full retreat of all German troops from the border, demobilisation of Landwehr divisions and a political resolution of the crisis in Lorraine.\n\nThis is an obvious victory for the Commune since the aggressive imperialists have been forced to kneel down before the workers and peasants' unstoppable might. But we should also be wary of a ruse de guerre from the treacherous Generalstab and strike before Germany does..."
 pre_war_events.51.d:9 "Germany has finally given in to our legitimate claims and will pay 10 million Marks as compensation for the shelling of Avricourt. The German government will also provide us with raw materials including coal and iron ore as well as machines for reconstruction purposes.\n\nSince this decision leaves the Reich humiliated and Syndicalism avenged and triumphant, we do not have any reason anymore to keep military pressure at the border; the Chief of Staff has announced that the number of troops deployed at the German border would be back to normal as soon as German divisions have been brought back from Alsace and Lorraine from their previous positions."
 pre_war_events.52.d:9 "German greed has been, once again, stronger than wisdom! The German Chancellor, in a radio broadcast, has announced that his government would refuse to pay \"a single pfennig\" and threatened \"to make Paris suffer the same fate as Avricourt if the French do not give up their claims and call back their troops from the Empire's borders!\".\n\nOur plan to drive the German Empire down to diplomatic defeat has failed, and now we are left with two options - facing defeat, while tens of thousands workers are rallying in Paris \"to march on Berlin, the vicious capital of the reaction\" and some top-ranking officers are rumoured to set up a coup against the civilian Comité de Salut Public... or risking war with the German Empire."
 pre_war_events.54.d:9 "The French answer to our compensation demands has been an increasing level of military actions at our border and terrorist attacks in Metz and Strassburg and threats of total war! In a broadcasted message to the French nation, the chairman of the Comité de Salut Public declared that \"we will not pay the barbarian Germans with gold, but with red flags, those very red flags our brave soldiers, with the help of the oppressed German proletariat, will soon raise above Strasbourg, Francfort, Berlin, Munich, Hambourg, Breslau and Königsberg!\".\n\nIn Berlin, as thousands march in the street under \"Nach Paris\" banners, the opposition in the Reichstag denounces \"a spineless, reckless policy\", the Generalstab and the Kaiser remains silent. We now only have to choose between humiliation, political crisis and civil unrest... or risk a war with the Commune."

 armenia_events.830.d:9 "Armenia's fires of resistance did not simply turn into an open flame of rebellion all by themselves. Rather, it was the anti-Ottoman coalition from [EGY.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to [PER.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that has given us hope. Hope that we won't fail in our quest for independence. Hope that we must not face the Ottoman Empire alone, but may instead fight as equals in a wide front against the Porte's oppression.\n\nNow that the war is on and the entire Middle East has been set ablaze, voices within the country calling for increased military cooperation with our allies have grown louder and louder. In particular, many within the government are looking towards [PER.GetNameDef] as a potential ally and protector, given their military might and close proximity to our country. As such, it has now been proposed to organise a meeting between Armenian and [PER.GetAdjective] officials to discuss the prospect of deepened cooperation for the duration of the war against the Ottoman Empire."

 armenia_events.83.d:9 "Having revolted against the Ottoman Empire shortly after we declared our own war against the Turks, the Armenians have now found themselves rather isolated from the main coalition against the Empire. Since we're more or less the only country in their reach, and a rather powerful one at that, [FROM.GetLeader] has approached our government and requested a meeting to be organised, which took place shortly thereafter in the city of Tabriz. There, government officials from Armenia presented our representatives with a proposal: cooperation in the form of an alliance between our two states, which should at least last until the Ottoman beast has been slain.\n\nThough this may sound like a good opportunity to better our relations with our new neighbour on paper, it is rather questionable how much Armenia could contribute to the alliance, and it could turn out to be a burden that would only pull us down. Still, it's most definitely an offer worth considering."

 belgium_events.362.d:9 "As decided on the First Belgian Congress, the Belgian Republic has been founded. To form a strong government however the Belgian people have voted for their first President. As the rebellion was led by many different factions there is no clear winner. The BWP, Belgian Workers Party, has been divided by internal struggles and has not proposed a clear candidate. Three main splinter factions have been created and are each proposing their own agenda. Paul-Henri Spaak, influenced by his liberal heritage has created a social liberal faction and has proposed a clear plan to guide Belgium. Another movement has declared their support for a grand industrial plan, Plan Van Acker, and have distanced themselves from the main party. The remnants of the party are still struggling to reform the party but have promised to continue their syndicalist agenda. Lastly there is the Liberal party, led by Paul-Emile Janson, who will guide the country to the image of our Dutch neighbours."

This caused an uproar on the left and right, with the right accusing the Jews of making the government their puppet while the left accuses the government of prioritising one labour organisation over the others.

When the trappings of the monarchy are lacking, it is only a matter of time before subjects start to question the righteousness of their station. Nowhere is this more important than in the ranks of the Emirate's armies, whose soldiers are dressed in a motley hodge-podge of uniforms. In the past few years, attempts have been made to unify the dress of our soldiers, but each attempt has been stymied by syphoned resources and mixed priorities.\n\nA recent parade, meant to celebrate the anniversary of our wonderful Emir's birthday and rise to his position as ruler of Bukhara, ended in embarrassment, as we were unable to find suitably well-dressed men to supplement the ranks, leaving the parade a display of our failures. This disaster has once again brought this issue to the forefront among a number of our military leaders, who have requested that we pursue a concerted effort to produce a single universal Bukharan uniform of acceptable quality, at least for those men expected to march in annual holiday parades!"
 bukhara_events.210.d:9 "While the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand are well-guarded by local militias and the Emir's soldiers, the Emirate's countryside remains a mostly lawless land. Local tribes do their best to maintain peace among their own, but no one polices the trading roads which serve as the foundation of our economy. While our patchwork of governors and tribal leaders have managed to keep the wheels of commerce spinning, albeit slowly, some merchant families have come directly to the Ark, seeking our help. According to them, gangs of bandits have secured control over the southern passes between Qarshi and Samarkand, strangling trade in the region. While our forces would be more than able to secure these passes, we would have to pull away our men from other posts, potentially leaving us vulnerable elsewhere. After all, why should we bankroll the guards for merchant caravans, when they could just as easily pay themselves?"

But this time, instead of the kind old man, it was none other than Madzharov himself who opened the door!\n\nUnbeknownst to our patrol, they had stumbled upon a high-ranking ITRO meeting, with several key leaders present. After a fierce but short shootout, Madzharov lay dead on the ground alongside his second-in-command Ivan Ormandzhiev. Our forces also captured several subcommanders and, most critically, the ITRO's treasurer, Dimitar Tokmakov, essentially beheading the organisation."

The revolution has already begun and the aftershocks of capitalism's failure shall open the way for our victory. Already the imperialists in Shanghai and Tianjin tremble in fear, and their warlord lackeys face the awakening wrath of the peasants and workers of China. There is no time to waste! Today marks the beginning of the liberation of the Chinese masses, which when complete shall be the tipping point for the coming world revolution."
 CHI.introgame.009.a:9 "$france_events.999.a$"
 CHI.midgame.017.d:9 "Within the Party, one of the most common means of inter-factional bickering comes in newspapers and pamphlets from respective cliques to demonstrate their supposedly better understanding of Chinese society and history. Of the most popular newspapers read by Party members are Chen Gongbo's \"The Revolutionary Critic,\" Gu Mengyu's \"Advance,\" and Sun Fo's \"Reconstruction Review.\"\n\nChen Gongbo's Revolutionary Critic features a collaboration of writers within the RCA's most radical wings, including Shi Cuntong, Guo Chuntao, and Xu Deheng. Their writings mainly deal with their desire to see the Party reorganised and restructured once more, a more complete \"Reorganisation\" than the 1924 party reshuffle. To them, the revolution must be led by a cadre of revolutionary intellectuals, and the masses must be drawn towards them as they are the true vanguard of the national revolution. The Critic's writings deal with mostly scientific and Marxist terms, with writers like Chen frequently using words such as materialism to dictate their thought processes.\n\nGu Mengyu's Advance shows that Gu and his followers were well-read on Marxism, but they rejected the notion that Marxism was scientific or historical - instead they call  for a similar reorganisation expressed by Chen and his followers but with less radical means. To Gu, there is no need for a \"class base\" of the Party as Chinese society had not yet developed into a class society - instead, the KMT should represent \"all oppressed peoples.\"\n\nSun Fo's Reconstruction Review differed in the Reorganisationists in that the writers of the Review argue that the KMT should not be reorganised but rather reconstructed. To these writers, the KMT has been tainted since the United Front, and the RCA-Radicals merely echoed the tenets of Marxism rather than adhering to the orthodox theory of Sun Yat-sen. Furthermore, they also disagree with PAC, seeing PAC's populism and PAC's flexibility in working with syndicalists as a potential threat to the National Revolution's success."
 CHI.midgame.400.d:9 "A paramount raison d'etre for the revolution is the liberation of the peasant from exploitative tenantry and landlords. Land reform is a rallying cry for the party, and the much publicised successes in MinGan proves to be a major draw. The realities of governing however have not been as idyllic. Replicating the apparent accomplishments in MinGan has been difficult and divisive despite a shared goal of peasant run cooperatives.\n\nChen Gongbo, the leading RCA ideologue, has argued that China is a semi-feudal state that requires political organisation before a social revolution could occur. While class conflict is inevitable, he believes the mass movement requires a different handling than in Europe. Chen Duxiu and the CSP-Orthodox have come to adopt this stance, however many CSP-Radicals continue to argue that China's problem is not feudal institutions but the domination of urban capitalists, and must adopt a proletarian socialist revolution.\n\nGu Mengyu and many RCA-Moderates contend that class struggle is not inevitable, and that China is an incipient capitalistic nation dominated by feudal lords. They, the World Society, and others call for a non-violent land reform focused on rent caps and moderate redistributions. Not included in the discussion are the commoners themselves, who often know little of Marxism, syndicalism or nationalism and cling onto traditions and superstitions - a dissonance not uncommon in vanguardist politics.\n\nAs pilot programmes for land reform begin in Jiangsu, these clashing philosophies take centre stage. Until now, redistribution has been implemented on an ad-hoc basis by various commanders and commissars, creating a patchwork and inefficient system. The PAC have pushed for allowing peasants to organise from the get-go, with the party coordinating them later. The RCA have encouraged having magistrates to organise land first before giving it to the peasants, and condemn what they see as subversive PAC activity. Some extremists have privately urged the need for total nationalisation until the end of tutelage, saying it is a wartime measure."

 CHI.endgame.451.d:9 "As one of the most prominent members of the Four Elders, the elderly Zhang Renjie is nearing retirement. Born into a wealthy family in Zhejiang, Zhang helped organise business with a successful trade company with branches in London, Paris, and New York - becoming one of the wealthiest Chinese at the time. Ironically, he developed an interest in anarchism and used his wealth to help fund Sun Yat-Sen's revolution. A stalwart figure in the Party, Zhang served as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee and even became one of the witnesses who witnessed the signing of Sun's will.\n\nZhang is known for his large family particularly his many daughters (10) through his two wives:\n\nThe eldest daughter, Theresa Zhang married Qu Lianfu, a wealthy businessman and law student at Columbia University in 1930 during the KMT's exile. The second daughter \"Yvonne\" Zhang Zhiying studied at Columbia as well and married Zhou Junmei, general manager of Jingnan Railway Company. The third daughter, Suzanne Zhang is a pianist and her recordings are frequently played on the Central Broadcasting System. The fourth daughter, Georgette Zhang is a painter. She is married to none other than Chen Youran, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of China. The fifth daughter Helen Zhang is an aviator who is married to Lin Kesheng, the current Minister of Health.\n\nZhang Renjie has several other daughters Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Naiheng, Zhang Naili, Zhang Naichen, and Zhang Naixun.

Weary of outsiders in their land however, the Costa Ricans never fully embraced their new citizens and kept a distinct distance from them. Over the years this has led to friction between the two parties which only escaped escalation due to the geographical features keeping them apart.\n\nFaltering profits from the coffee trade however and a general consciousness amongst the negro population have let the two groups once more collide.

 costa_rica_events.70.d:9 "Malcontent with the heavy handed and authoritarian rule of Cortés, ex-president Ricardo Jiménez has once again thrown his hat in the ring for the presidency, hoping to build on the large supporter base his previous tenure has nourished. Reactions from the left have thus far been very warm as they hope that infighting within the PRN will allow them to take control in the upcoming elections. Cortés himself is all but pleased and has been seen secretly planning with his party members to sabotage the Jiménez campaign."

Whether this means that the Cortés regime has finally ended or merely changed heads is as of yet unsure but the Costa Rican populace is euphoric by the victory of democracy."

 costa_rica_events.81.d:9 "With war raging all across the globe and the Costa Rican treasury slinking by the day, President [COS.GetLeader] has set his sights on the valuable properties of the German coffee barons. By controlling public opinion through the state media and the emergency powers recently granted to our president, Calderón is now fully capable of stripping these Germans off their land and confiscating their properties to support his money slurping welfare state."
 costa_rica_events.83.d:9 "Enraged by the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed individual rights due to Calderón's emergency powers has led both the Democratic party under Cortés (who broke ties with the PRN after Calderón seized full control and founded his own party) and the syndicalist party under Manuel Mora Valverde to openly denounce the President for infringing on electoral liberty.\n\nSince their complaints fell on deaf ears in the PRN dominated Congress and since president Calderón has no intention to give up his emergency powers, voices from the sidelines have started calling for a coup against the dictatorial regime.

 costa_rica_events.881.d:9 "As President Calderón has been forcefully deposed in Costa Rica by a coalition of conservatives and syndicalists, an opportunity has presented itself to fully incorporate their nation into our dreams of a united Centroamérica.

 costa_rica_events.122.t:9 "Punctuality in the Regime of Cortés"
 costa_rica_events.122.d:9 "Whilst often criticised for being harsh or severe in punishment, the government of [COS.GetLeader] has profiled itself as one of order, discipline and strict punctuality. Vigorously promoting the honesty and efficiency of the Public Employees, Cortés himself has on more than one occasion been seen patrolling the government offices early in the morning to inspect the punctuality and attendance of his employees. Should he spot that one of his subordinates is slacking or is taking bribes, he will immediately be requested to resign no matter his political affiliations.\n\nWhilst this policy has turned many of Cortés' former friends against him, he is praised by the common man for combating corruption and making the state run more efficiently."
 costa_rica_events.123.d:9 "Written by famous leader of the Atlantic Workers Congress, Carlos Luis Fallas, the novel \"Mamita Yunai\" has been received very well by the working class and has been praised as one of the greatest literary works in Costa Rican history.\n\nRecounting the tale of a man named José Francisco Sibaja, an activist of the Workers and Peasants Block, the novel starts when he is sent by his party to control a vote in Talamanca that is known to be fraudulent. Travelling to one of the last areas populated by Indians, where almost no Spanish is spoken, this first part, recounts the vicissitudes through which Sibajita goes to find the polling station and reach it, despite the obstacles put by local authorities. The activist understands his impotence and tries at least to substantially reduce the extent of the fraud in which he partially succeeds by convincing the police chief and local representatives. In the end however, his effort proves to be but a drop of water in the sea and he return back to Limón content with his success and unaware of how little impact his actions have had.\n\nDescribing in great detail the poverty and harsh lives of the Indians he encounters, the tale is meant to be shocking and eye-opening for the establishment in charge and to show the people how little they have done."
 costa_rica_events.130.d:9 "The time for war has finally come as the first Canadian boots are landing ashore in Puerto Limón ready to force themselves the Panamanian heartland seizing the Canal and deposing their government with unrelenting force.

 ELS_depression_remnants_desc:9 "The Great Depression in the United States largely devastated our coffee market, and instability consumed our nation throughout the '20s as a result. Through numerous banking reforms and natural dissipation over time, the depression has largely left El Salvador but still affects our nation in some places."
 ELS_country_intro_content:9 "Maximiliano Hernández Martínez's coup as Vice-President against the Laborista Party and Arturo Araujo in December of 1931 brought immediate strife to the nation, with a true restoration of democracy being ended right as it began. The cause of this coup was an alarming salary cut for the military in favour for the police, which helped him get a small amount of support from the population. With his policy of suppressing all opposition, militarisation of the state, and banning all other parties from elections besides his Pro-Patria Party, Martínez managed to consolidate his grip on El Salvador. While this was effective at first, this all changed on May 16th, 1932.\n\nThe 1932 Peasant Massacre began due to Martínez enacting policies against the natives in the west, who had been inspired by Agustín Farabundo Martí and Feliciano Ama. While they weren't a threat at first, the success of the Nicaraguan Revolution by Augusto César Sandino made more people flock to the rebel side. Despite the rebels not being able to make gains against the military, Zapata's victory in the Mexican elections meant they would get a steady supply of guns. The rebellion managed to last until January 22nd, 1933 with 70,000 dead and rebel leaders Feliciano Ama and Agustín Farabundo Martí retreating to Mexico.\n\nPartisans are no longer an uncommon sight within El Salvador, with Martínez's regime being hated by a significant portion of the people. Not only that but his way of handling the rebellion has caused disloyal elements of the military to emerge, and Martínez's regime being held on a tight string the Americans are holding up."

Once the army was in range of the strikers, shots were ordered to be fired to scare them into dispersing. However, fearing a violent reaction, many soldiers shot the crowd head on, and chaos ensued in the city, with the strikers either trying to fight off the soldiers unsuccessfully or running away. Martial law was temporarily declared by Martínez to deal with any dissidents, and the strikers that have been caught have been already sentenced to death by Martínez's decree..."

While they have kept the same production levels, the fruit of their work just sits in harbours with no place to go, as there are no longer any foreign buyers to acquire them. This has caused our agricultural output to be reduced significantly, and many of the peasants to be fired due to the lack of funding to pay their wages. In order to solve this and kickstart the agricultural sector back into motion, President Martínez has decreed the creation of a new set of state subsidies. These will be given to all the farmlands that produce coffee, sugar and cotton and will be funded by the Federación de Cajas de Crédito Rural, with the objective of improving the production of these vital crops back to their pre-Black Monday levels."
 el_salvador_events.34.d:9 "After many quite days, Martínez and the legislative assembly came forward to announce the approval of a new constitution. While very similar to the previous one, it extends the presidential term from 4 to 6 years and grants the assembly the ability to have the final say on the winner of all future election if there are deem to be any \"extraordinary circumstance\" surrounding the election.\nThese changes were very clearly made to grant Martínez a way to indefinitely extent his rule over the country and were immediately made use of as the assembly proclaim him as the next president just mere hours after the fact.\nProtest were held around the country, but many of them were very small and gather little support from nearby people; it is clear that the people have very little interest in challenging Martínez either by indifference or fear of the repercussion."
 el_salvador_events.60.d:9 "Today, we've found out that General Castro had abandoned his barracks in Talnique and we've received reports from our scouts that he has deserted to the rebel forces with a whole regiment. While he had displayed some concerns about the strength of the rebel forces, his desertion still came as a surprise to the general staff."
 el_salvador_events.110.d:9 "After sending our army to face the rebels head-on, we're met with catastrophic failure. Upon arrival to the occupied area, our force was met by consecutive guerrilla attacks throughout the region, and those skirmishes culminated in a resounding defeat at the small town of Armenia, where several squadrons of our army outright defected, while others became completely paralysed due to internal strife between officers. The army is now making its way back to San Salvador, where Osmín Aguirre y Salinas has already sent a message back requesting an immediate meeting with the president."
 el_salvador_events.113.d:9 "Ex-President Arturo Araujo, who was deposed by the coup led by Martínez in 1932, and who is now the current leader of the Partido Laborista, has expressed his support for the rebels, and has urged every Salvadoran who wants to defend democracy in the country to join the rebels in order to fight the tyrants. His influence over the populace can't be underestimated, and several patrols had to be dispatched to the border towns in order to ensure that the people wouldn't outright join the rebellion. Our situation grows dire by the day..."
 el_salvador_events.114.d:9 "By Martínez's command, our forces have been scattered throughout the western border and they are ready to face the enemy in a protracted war. However, our forces have been spread thin, and now partisan groups have begun staging attacks on San Salvador itself. With the rebels renewing their offensive in the West, we now have to decide on whether we reinforce the front line or spread our troops to deal with these partisan groups."
 el_salvador_events.126.d:9 "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina has announced today the reformation of the Partido Nacional Democratico or PND. A liberal coalition party, Quiñónez aims to restore the liberal policies that were prevalent during the 'Dinastía Meléndez-Quiñónez'. While largely unpopular within the working class, Quiñónez's promises of wealth have proven to be very effective with the entrepreneurial middle class, as well as with the more moderates in the armed forces which see the Partido Laborista as nothing more than a syndicalist ruse to take over El Salvador."
 el_salvador_events.200.d:9 "Today, the writer, journalist and suffragette Prudencia Ayala has passed away peacefully in her sleep. Ayala was born to a native family and became known in El Salvador for predicting the victory of the Kaiser in the Weltkrieg and the United States neutrality throughout the war, being associated initially with esoteric practices. However, she used that fame to push for the recognition of female rights and the female vote in El Salvador, publishing several books and articles about it, and even trying to run for President in 1930. Her political career was short lived as the supreme court rejected her attempt to run for president, but the attempt has sparked the debate on the woman's role in the Salvadoran society, and her legacy still continues to shape the national feminist movement."
 el_salvador_events.202.d:9 "Due to the recent weather, the Ilopango Lake overflowed and began flooding the small towns of Valle Dolores and Apulo along its shores. While there are no reported casualties by the flooding, there are still pockets of our citizens trapped by the flood which have limited supplies and will need government help in order to be rescued. Since we lack any formal navy or coast guard in order to help the victims immediately, many members of our staff are presenting plans to help the victims as the civilian populace has begun making donations to help their fellow countryman."
 el_salvador_events.213.d:9 "Since the colonial era, El Salvador has had a really strong Christian movement which has adopted many of Christian traditions into its national culture. One of the main celebrations in El Salvador besides Easter and Christmas is known as the 'Fiestas patronales de San Salvador' (Patron Saint Festivities of San Salvador) or simply the 'Fiestas Agostinas'. During these week-long festivities, several religious ceremonies and fairs are held to commemorate the transfiguration of Jesus as told in the New Testament. On the last day, the celebrations are paired with a procession from San Salvador Cathedral to the Parade Grounds, and donations are gathered by different organisations in order to provide support for the people and the government."
 el_salvador_events.214.d:9 "The Fiestas Agostinas have begun once more, and our country is now rejoicing once more in celebration for our religious beliefs."
 el_salvador_events.217.d:9 "The San Miguel Carnival has started once more, as per our yearly schedule of celebrations, and our people are now enjoying the carnival while the influx of tourists is now bringing us extra profits for us to utilise."

He had been learning the ropes of governance from his time as Vice-President for his Brothers-in-law Carlos Meléndez and Jorge Meléndez from 1915 to 1918 and then from 1919 to 1923 respectively; becoming Provisional President in 1914 and 1919 first and then being elected as Constitutional President in 1923. Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñónez Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Quiñónez's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absence have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Quiñónez once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Quiñónez has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadoran nation and its people.§!"

However, in the aftermath of the war, with our victory over the greatest threat east of the Dnieper now secured, such an idea has moved from the fringes of our allied nations' opposition, to the annals of their governments. However, what comes as a great surprise to Berlin is who seeks to be free from Germany today - Finland.\n\nIn spite of our nations' amicable relationship, one which has been strengthened through the rule of King [Root.GetLeader], Wilhelm II's"

The fool he once was.\n\nUltimately, the decision falls to [Root.GetSecondInCommand].

With our duties complete and the war in the east finally over, many Finnish veterans greet the news warmly, knowing that their efforts have assured that the next generation will find peace in the land their forefathers fought valiantly to protect.\n\nToday, a military parade was held in Helsinki. German soldiers performed a military march in the Senaatintori (Senate Square), with King [Root.GetLeader] in attendance. Once the formalities were complete, the King gave a short speech for his German compatriots:\n\n\"To the soldiers of Germany, the nation of Finland and its people are eternally thankful for your efforts during both Weltkriegs. Had it not been for your efforts in nineteen-seventeen, Finland may have found itself subjugated once more. And now, through the efforts of these past few years, we once again stand free.

In the Second Weltkrieg, the sons of those veterans would fight for what their fathers gave everything for. Both times, Finland has survived. And both times, Germany stood by Finland.\n\nBecause of this - along with the risk of a new war looming over Europe - the German Reichstag has denied us our diplomatic autonomy. The veterans of the Second Weltkrieg and, soon, their sons will stand side by side with their German brothers-in-arms for the foreseeable future. For Berlin, the risk of war demands a strong and unified Europe. For Finland and her people, however, all this means is that peace, true peace, may not be found. The threat of war may forever loom over Finland, and another generation of Finns may have to die once more—perhaps not even on Finnish land itself.\n\nKing [Root.GetLeader] sat with the Päämaja (Defence Command), preparing future defense plans. Garrisons in Lappland. Border guards on the east and west. Coast guard along the cities. Minelaying routes along the coast. Expeditionary forces to Germany. Convoy routes for troops abroad. A strenuous chain of responsibilities for both Finland and the whole of Europe. [Root.GetLeader] wondered if the Finnish people were truly happy. "

Two years after the 4th Zhili-Fengitan War, Zhang Xueliang sent Wu overseas, this time to Europe, to study more about artillery, enabling him to obtain more insights into modern artillery warfare.

The Central American Federation disintegrated in 1838, Venezuela and Ecuador withdrew from Gran Colombia in 1830, Argentina and Brazil fought continuously over Uruguay, all three countries joined forces to defeat Paraguay in the Paraguayan War (1865-1870), and Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia in the War of the Pacific.\n\n20th century, however, brings Hispanoamericanist ideas back to life. With imperialist powers attempting to subjugate the South American nations via economic dominance, political influence and military force, [ROOT.GetLeader] feels that the only way for Hispanic America to defend itself against imperialism is by forging a united South-American front.\n\nA new entity, 'Andesia', is envisioned by [ROOT.GetLeader] as a state that will unite Hispanic South America from mountains of Chile to oil fields of Venezuela under communist banner, with himself as a leader guiding the united South America to its better future.

With our efforts to conscript as much manpower as possible from whichever source we could find, proper screening of the political allegiance of recruits has been clearly undercut to facilitate recruitment and this should probably come as no surprise to us. To add insult to injury, the Communists have been fast to point out that the column had a clear lack of commissars, further challenging our government's decision to refuse their implementation and polarising the situation even further."
 patagonia_events.200.d:9 "Despite the fact that our armies have liberated the populace from their bourgeois oppressors, many have taken to the street to protest our takeover, especially as they consider that the country has been taken over by tyrants. Many political parties like the UCR, the PDP, the PDN and the UCRA, continue to stoke the fires even further, calling this a return to the 'old ways' of the corrupt PAN that had kept a fraudulent grip on the country not even two decades earlier. While our forces are already in the field trying to disperse the protestors, it's clear that, outside of the traditional Industrial Proletariat, we lack any significant support. In order to solidify our administration, we will need to improve our legitimacy like we did in Patagonia when the revolution began, and prove to the nation we're not just another tool of oppression against the people..."

 france_events.28.d:9 "The Third Internationale was founded in 1921, in the aftermath of the revolution. Our forefathers fostered within the organisation a pluralist, big tent attitude: anarchists, communists, socialists, syndicalists, pacifists, anti-colonialists, even some social democrats were convened, in the hopes of rebuilding the foundations of the global proletarian movement, battered by the war years.\n\nEvery year, then every few years, we have held congresses to discuss and direction the direction of the socialist struggle. We are proud to say we will soon be ready to hold the ninth edition of these meetings, right here, in and around Paris. More than a simple conference, this shall be a grand celebration of the struggle for proletarian liberation!"
 france_events.41.d:9 "After months of feverish preparation, the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale has opened in Versailles. People from all over the world convened to help coordinate the efforts of the socialist movement. Parties affiliated with the Internationale, as well as some sympathisers and observers, were invited to send representatives and hundreds made the sometimes arduous journey to be closest to the beating heart of the proletarian Revolution.\n\nThough the Internationale has in theory no relation to the French and British governments, representatives from these foremost socialist nations will certainly enjoy a position of informal seniority among their peers, elders in the global liberation of the labouring class."
 france_events.42.d:9 "The inaugural session of the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale took place in the Versailles palace, clad for the occasion in crimson banners adorned with socialist symbols and slogans. Given the honour of pronouncing the introductory speech, father of the British revolution George Lansbury pointed out the irony of convening proletarian forces in what was once the centre of the autocratic monarchy, proof if any was needed of the unstoppable march forward of the Revolution. A grand speech followed, thanking the delegates, evoking the revolutionary successes of recent years and rousing spirits for the coming struggle.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Lansbury invited the delegates to join him in a minute of prayer, to which a French voice promptly responded “Like hell we will!”, leading to a few moments of agitation in the audience. The old man was nevertheless abundantly applauded, and the representatives separated into various discussion groups and committees."
 france_events.43.d:9 "Joaquín Ascaso Budriá has taken the stage and elaborated the position of the CNT-FAI in Spain for the Congress. The CNT-FAI is the largest syndicalist party in Spain, made up of anarcho-syndicalists, moderate syndicalists and trade unionists. The Spanish revolutionaries have seen a White Terror, violent counter-revolutionary actions taking against the workers, first-hand.\n\nThey have come, asking for support for their cause when the moment comes. A resolution to support the efforts of the Spanish proletarian forces was unanimously voted, with cries of “¡Viva la Revolución!” echoing in the halls of Versailles."
 france_events.45.d:9 "We heard Joaquín Ascaso Budriá speak of White Terror horror stories that have been coming out of Madrid and Barcelona, and Kurt Eisner, Bavarian Socialist wanted to delve deeper into the topic of White Terror and he was given the floor.\n\nAfter hearing more stories that have come out of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia and Finland, the Congress members were ready to make their decisions."
 france_events.47.d:9 "American delegate John Reed gave a passionate speech: a journalist by trade, one of the first Americans to report on the Russian and French revolutions, he later entered the political fray himself. Now a well-respected voice in the movement, he has announced his bid in the 1936 presidential election for the SPA. Despite criticism at home and abroad that this would draw him towards reformism, the prospect of seeing a staunch socialist at the helm of the United States is too enticing for any fellow delegates to voice much concern, and Reed was given a warm welcome by the Congress.\n\nIn his speech, he detailed the current situation in the United States: the Great Depression, now dragging on for years, has thrown American workers and farmers into atrocious conditions, leading to a rapid rise in radical politics, made worse by the German crash. The labour movement grows ever more powerful, the SPA is rapidly gaining ground in political institutions, and proletarian forces are holding strong against police repression and Longist reactionary militias: an opportunity seems bound to reveal itself."
 france_events.50.d:9 "A joint event by Latin American comrades was held next. South and Central America have in recent years been at the forefront of the socialist struggle. Primary victims of American interests, exploited ceaselessly by international Capital, held down by petty dictators puppet of this or that 'Yanqui' lobby, the masses of the Americas have had enough. Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation.\n\nA packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America. Delegates from other nations, like Brazil or Cuba, gave detailed presentations on the state of the proletarian struggle in their own countries, with many feeling very much optimistic for their prospects in the coming years."
 france_events.51.d.FRA:9 "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with a flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat.\n\nHowever, heeding this call is likely to cause some disturbances among the more 'conservative' elements of the society."
 france_events.51.d.other:9 "Today the British feminist, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with a flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's participation in industry and armed forces, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat.\n\nWhile our delegation agrees wholeheartedly with her message, some fear that it is yet too early to really push the issue of women's liberation and that formally affirming the speech is but a needless domestic disturbance."
 france_events.52.d:9 "Yesterday Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution. According to her arguments, without women's full participation in the struggle, it may be impossible to defeat the many enemies of the proletariat.\n\nTempting as it may seem, the political climate in Britain is not ready for such decision - we need to wait for the Congress of Trade Unions in the fall to force the matter."
 france_events.53.d:9 "Today is an opportunity for our representatives at the Congress of the Third Internationale to put forward their case forward to request international support for our reunification efforts.\n\nThe Foreign Minister believes French support for Risorgimento could be vital for its success due to the potential for Austrian involvement."
 france_events.54.d:9 "Delegates from the Socialist Republic of Italy appeared before the Congress, making the case of supporting the Republic in its efforts to reunify the Italian Peninsula in the face of the traitors beyond the Po, the Sicilian Kingdom and their theocratic vassal in Rome.\n\nInvolvement in Italy could prove beneficial in spreading the Revolution, but could lead to conflict with the reactionary Austrian Empire responsible for protecting the regime in Milan."
 france_events.55.d:9 "With the Berlin Stock Market Crash, mass unemployment has arisen in Europe and South America and trade unions have begun to grow in both as a result. French and British governments held highly secretive talks, and slowly, but surely one realisation came to all: now might be the hour, now might be the moment, a tremendous effort must be undertaken. However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world's free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly.\n\nNaturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular: by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."
 france_events.56.d:9 "As the congress approaches its end, young Jawaharlal Nehru takes the floor to explain the precarious state of our revolutionary government.\n\nIn his speech, he strongly called for international support in building a people's army to rival our enemies in Lahore and Hyderabad."
 france_events.57.d:9 "The Bharatiya People's Republic asked for support in their struggle against its neighbours - the Dominion of India and the Princely Federation.\n\nThey would like us to send military advisors to train their leaders and their troops."
 france_events.58.d:9 "Comrade Saïl Mohamed, a prominent Algerian socialist, was allowed to speak before the assembled Congress. He has given a rousing speech on the situation in Morocco and French Africa where Arab labour is abused and exploited for the benefit of the wealthy and the colonial establishment.\n\nSail urged the Congress to put an immediate stop to the situation. He proposed a creation of the Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee that will work to supply local socialist anti-colonial conspirators in North Africa."
 france_events.62.d:9 "After our delegates at the Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale requested military support for organising the Indian revolutionary army, the Union of Britain and Commune of France decided to dispatch senior military officials and experts to educate our foremost officers.\n\nHopefully, this cooperation will yield beneficial results on the battlefield!"
 france_events.63.d.GER:9 "The word has spread. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\n\nThis body will coordinate the syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Our intelligence reports show that a small influx of Egyptian left-wing radicals who want to fight for the revolutionary cause are also arriving on French territory. While we are not at war with the Commune of France or any syndicalist country for now, we should be very cautious."
 france_events.63.d.OTT:9 "The word has spread from German agents in France. The Commune of France, alongside other members of the Internationale, has established a Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee. The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\n\nThis body will coordinate the syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause. The initiative also plays in with Egypt's attempt to foster Arab nationalism in the Middle East and North Africa, and might strengthen our rival. For these reasons, we have to be cautious, even if we won't be a main target."

Around the table of the meeting, French, British, Algerian, Senegalese or even Tunisian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day. It was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the French government in Algiers to weaken their hold over Africa.\n\nWhat was left to debate however, is how exactly are we going to hurt them. Our options could be to start a wave of sabotage and insurrectional strikes across their industry, heavily supporting rebel elements in a specific region or to foment unrest more evenly throughout Africa by using a large propaganda network. What should we do?"

Around the table of the meeting, French, British and Algerian representatives are present to discuss the matter of the day.\n\nIt was decided before that a large operation was to be conducted against the remnant of the French government in Algiers to weaken what's left of their hold over Africa. It was in the end decided that, in this situation, the only sensible option was to start a wave of strikes and sabotage to hurt their industrial base."
 france_events.66.d:9 "Without any previous notice, a large wave of violent strikes started in some of our industrial bases. Those strikes are different than what we are used to, they are only done by a small part of the workers and don't seem to have any clear motive, factory bosses throughout the country only woke up to an occupied factory and to a lot of the equipment smashed.\n\nIn other factories, the workers weren't occupying the factory, but a large part of the machinery was still found damaged or destroyed. Repressing the strikes and arresting their participants wasn't too difficult, but it seems to be a shot in the dark as those incidents were clearly masterminded from elsewhere..."
 france_events.67.d:9 "The colonial authorities and the Second Bureau have reported to us than an unusual influx of arms and equipment has been flowing to one of our colonies in the last weeks. This all evidently coming from the Commune of France, using the darkness of the night to smuggle arms into our territory, destabilise us and incite rebellion.\n\nWe took too long however to uncover that scheme, and the revolutionaries are now well armed enough to be emboldened in their resistance. We only have to hope we will be able to weather the storm."
 france_events.68.d:9 "In the last weeks, we have noticed an increased propaganda activity, coming from nationalist and syndicalist agitators. It looks like they were suddenly equipped with tens of thousands of leaflets and pre-prepared radio speeches, spreading their words about the wrongdoings of our regime everywhere in Africa. Propaganda, even more when supported by the Commune of France, is hard to stop, we can't possibly confiscate every leaflet spreading in our colonies.\n\nThis isn't entirely a lost battle though, as we can try to focus on a specific region in which our agents will shut down the radios and confiscate every suspect document. By doing this, we will be at least able to reduce the effects of the campaign in one or two regions of our choice..."
 france_events.71.d:9 "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to redefine its approach towards the global revolution.\n\nSince the last Congress of the Internationale took place in France, many activists believe it would be the best to make Britain the next host."
 france_events.72.d:9 "Our British comrades have confirmed their readiness to host the Tenth International Congress in London.\n\nIt is time for [ROOT.GetNameDef] to confirm its participation."
 france_events.86.d:9 "With all the delegates in London, the Tenth Congress of the Internationale begun with a speech by comrade Eric Blair.\n\nIn his so-called 'Shield-and-Sword speech' he underlined the need for the Internationale to double its efforts towards forging the 'Damocles' - a weapon capable of destroying the reactionaries across the world once and for all."
 france_events.87.d:9 "On the second day the delegates discussed the most pressing matter - the development of the Civil War in America.\n\nWith Long and the Federal government pushing the WCA onto the defensive, the decision was made to send additional help for Reed and his followers."
 france_events.90.d:9 "Our French comrades have agreed to send us additional help.\n\nTransported from Mexico under constant air threat, a trove of industrial equipment and advanced machine tools as well as industrial advisors have arrived in Chicago."

 france_events.97.d:9 "With the American question settled, Ernest Hemingway, [WCA.GetNameDef]' delegate to the Congress, took the stage. He thanked all those who supported the American cause and called on the socialist world to constantly battle the reactionaries.\n\nThe speech was received with great applause, especially by the French delegation."
 france_events.98.d:9 "The socialist delegate to the Second International Congress, Ernest Hemingway, has today given a speech, condemning our actions against the WCA and calling for intensified support for the Reds in this war.\n\nWe must redouble our efforts and crush Reed before he receives any additional help."
 france_events.99.d:9 "Along with the politicians in London, a separate meeting of scientists from France and Britain took place in the old university in Cambridge.\n\nIt was decided that the socialist countries should combine their research in order to develop a weapon capable of protecting the Revolution from the increasingly aggressive imperialist threat."
 france_events.100.d:9 "The socialist regime in Santiago is surrounded by reactionaries, especially in Argentina.\n\nIt seems that the best way to protect the government is to ask for international support via the Congress of the Internationale."
 france_events.101.d:9 "The Chileans have asked for assistance in improving their army in the face of hostile imperialist foes such as Argentina.\n\nBordered on virtually all sides by threats, Chile's position might become increasingly precarious without our help. Furthermore, they could prove invaluable at safeguarding the revolution in the New World."
 france_events.110.d:9 "With all important decisions made during the first week, the Congress has moved on to less pressing matters.\n\nAfter ten days of negotiations, discussion, and politicking, the delegates came up with one final act - a declaration of eternal brotherhood and readiness to face the imperialists, wherever they are to be found."
 france_events.127.d:9 "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries.\n\nAnd thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
 france_events.128.d:9 "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves.\n\nThe choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."
 france_events.129.d:9 "As part of the Phalanstère International programme, our comrades in Paris and London have just offered us much needed help.\n\nIndustrial machines, mining equipment, weapons, ammunition and more - all of this will be unloaded in our ports and airports and transported across the country - assuming we desire that."
 france_events.999.d:9 "$france_events.999.intro$\n\nOur nation, however, has decoupled itself from the capitalist world and has begun the construction of a true people's state. Therefore, we remain unaffected and can only watch as the nations of the world are eaten alive by their capitalist overlords.

Following the Turkish conquest of the 'Sanjak of Lazistan' in the mid-16th century, a policy of Islamisation was enforced, driving a religious wedge between the culturally fraternal Georgian and Lazi people.\n\nNonetheless, many in Tbilisi have celebrated Rize's liberation, and the Homshetsi, an Armenian minority living mostly to the east of the city, are overly joyous to have been freed from the grasp of the tyrants who had long persecuted them in the past. The Lazi, however, had over time grown rather content with Ottoman rule, and thus view the recent change in government with scepticism. Given Rize's proximity to the frontlines, many of them have not only lost their homes and loved ones in the war but have also seen their lives and hopes shattered by shells fired from our cannons, and it remains one of the major tasks of [ROOT.GetLeader] and [ROOT.GetLeader.GetHerHis] government to heal the wounds torn open by the conflict and to restore Lazi trust in Georgia and its people.\n\nNaturally, the process of rebuilding has already begun. Workers from across the country are cleaning up debris, and relief organisations are providing food and shelter for those in need. The Ottoman administration of Rize has by now been mostly replaced, the port, which had been largely destroyed by Ottoman troops following our advance, is now once again welcoming ships from across the Black Sea, and it seems that a state of normalcy is slowly returning to our new lands. Still, it remains to be seen how long it will take for the hearts of the Lazi people to mend, and for them to embrace our rule for what it truly is: liberation."

 germany_events.16.d:9 "Finding themselves under increasingly greater competition, Zentrum branches in competitive regions, such as Silesia, Westphalia and Hanover, have been struggling to maintain their ground against popular Social Democratic and right-wing candidates. To alleviate this disparity, Zentrum candidates and party branches have begun independently making deals with local parties to unite behind a common candidate in competitive districts and thus increase their chances of victory.\n\nIn Hanover, Zentrum has renewed its historic cooperation with the German-Hanoverian Party, commonly known as the Guelph Party (Welfen). A regionalist political party created after the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, it generally sat with Zentrum in the prewar Reichstag, however, the postwar years have seen it experience a sharp decline. The Guelph conservative federalism has struggled in the postwar environment and losing their last lease of life might just prove to be the end of the party.\n\nOn the other side of the Empire, Zentrum members in Posen have begun expanding their collaboration with Polish autonomists, particularly those closer to the ChZJN in Poland proper. Unlike in Hanover, the Polish ethnic constituency has not lost its potency, although it still needs to compete with anti-Polish electoral pacts in mixed constituencies. For them, much like for the Welfen, Zentrum is a natural ally, as they are both ideologically conservative and concerned with maintaining the federal model of the state, with hope of decentralising it further, against centralist encroachment from the left and the right alike. Not everyone in Zentrum subscribes to the idea of tagging along with a flock of weak minor parties, however."
 germany_black_monday_events.7.d:9 "The German agricultural sector, struggling for years at this point, has suffered greatly from the economic crisis sparked by the Black Monday market crash. It is the latest step in the persistent decline of German agriculture ever since the late 19th century; the culmination of many years of inefficient and outdated methods, unfortunate global market developments and stalling, poorly future-oriented agrarian policies.\n\nCompared to its Western competitors, such as Britain or the United States, German agriculture has consistently lagged behind in efficiency. Twenty five percent of all arable land across the Empire is held by 0.2 percent of the land owners, most of which are operating in East Elbia. But since the late 20s, small and mid-sized farmers all across the nation have started to feel the effects of this looming efficiency crisis as well: Steady price erosion for agricultural goods due to cheaper competition from abroad and shrivelling purchasing power have slowly led many farmers into the never-ending downwards spiral of growing indebtedness.\n\nWhat could initially be battled via the reintroduction of protective tariffs and import quotas, undoubtedly a controversial policy instrument within Mitteleuropa, has at the end of the day only postponed the inevitable. With the collapse of the German banking sector, the looming crisis will soon aggravate as many estates and enterprises which have relied on loans to stay afloat are bound to default on these in the near future, and the collapsing demand for agricultural goods could be the nail in the coffin. This substantial crisis has already begun to fuel the DkP electoral campaign and placed the question of a drastically different agricultural policy on the agenda. What many seem to have forgotten, though, is the fact that the conservatives are partly responsible themselves for this dilemma, via their candidate in the State Secretariat of Agriculture, Martin Schiele, and his controversial agricultural policies during the last decade. For now, his political fate is on a knife's edge."
 germany_swr_events.105.d:9 "The Koalition Schwarz-Weiß-Rot intend to fight for a return to traditionalism, order and sensible government and understand that returning Germany to a conservative order after decades of liberalism and single-minded opportunism, so the last thing they want is to be forced to rely on the cosmopolitan parliamentarians of the liberal parties, and perhaps in different circumstances they wouldn't. Today, Germany faces disaster. There is no end to the economic crisis in sight, while Germany stares down communist neighbors and revolutionary strikers only grow stronger. The front of the syndicalist world seems to move closer to the Reichstag daily.\n\nAlthough the LVP remain heavily opposed to us, a small group of its deputies were sensible enough to see that the chaos of the Schleicher cabinet could not continue and that supporting our government is the only way. They have resigned the whip of the party and chosen to affiliate themselves with the Eduard Dingeldey's NLP, who have offered to participate in the National Front. These deputies are expected to act more reputably than their former comrades, and we will welcome them to our side."

 germany_flavour_events.87.d:9 "Ever since the excavation of the Chernyakhov site near Kyiv in 1901, the Chernyakhov culture has been established to refer to the inhabitants of modern day Ukraine and Romania during the Late Roman period. It has been of great interest to European prehistorians - the Russians see in it a possible precursor to the Slavs, others considered it Sarmatian. After 1918, German researchers could freely access the numerous archaeological sites in Ukraine, and with enough findings systemized, the prehistorian Paul Reinecke has come forward with a convincing hypothesis - the Chernyakhov culture corresponds to the legendary Gothic kingdom of Oium.\n\nNumerous findings, from analogous ceramics to building construction, indicate that the Chernyakhov culture has been at least influenced by Germanic peoples to the north - fitting well into the history written by medieval Gothic historian Jordanes, who claims that after leaving Gothiscanza, the Goths settled in a fertile land in the south and created their own kingdom ruled by Filimer. Reinecke himself has been modest in his claims, but other, more patriotic German historians have taken his theories further. Claiming that there is little archeological proof of later migrations into the region, some claim that the Gothic population of Ukraine persisted on a large scale for a longer period than initially suggested - after all, we know that remnants of this Germanic population survived in Crimea over a thousand years after the reign of King Filimer.\n\nThis would, in turn, imply that the modern day Ukrainians are not originally Slavic and thus the 'triune Russian nation' idea promoted by Russian imperialists is a myth - rather, they are assimilated Germans, and should naturally stay with their origin country rather than return to the Russian colonial fold."
 germany_flavour_events.119.t:9 "White Terror in Brunswick"
 germany_flavour_events.119.d:9 "For months, the reactionary regime in Germany has struggled against an active movement for workers' rights in the industrial Ruhr region. It appears that this struggle has reached an explosive conclusion - the red flag was briefly raised in the state of Brunswick, where the local duke was overthrown by armed radicalized workers and a free socialist republic was declared. For a few days, headlines about this incident flooded the front pages of our newspapers, and to the more naive few, it seemed as if the fall of the reactionary Junker regime in Berlin was on the horizon.\n\nYet, no breakdown of state power occurred and a military intervention has since suppressed the uprising. German tanks and trucks roll through the streets of Brunswick, armed militias have been suppressed with violence, and peaceful strikers have been arrested and forced back to work. Furious articles report on the 'White Terror', sometimes exaggerating the details to sell the brutality of the act and whipping up the public into a frenzy. Just as much furor is directed towards the infamous German Social Democrats, who refused to follow us in overthrowing the shackles of capitalism and instead collaborated with the Kaiser's lackeys - is there greater proof that their so lauded 'peaceful reform of capitalism' is merely a myth?"

 germany_flavour_events.120.t:9 "The Party of the Middle"
 germany_flavour_events.120.d:9 "The establishment of the Christian People's Party only sharpened the existing divisions within the Catholics. Before and during the war, Zentrum proved itself pathetically incapable of defending the March Constitution it supposedly crafted and represented. Now, in the eyes of the Progressive wing, their toleration of the developing right-wing dictatorship will continue, as the CVP, dominated by the former Zentrum right wing, already seeks to collaborate with the government and present themselves as a 'loyal opposition'. The Progressives, who had long advocated for Zentrum to remain a Catholic party of the middle and actively defend German constitutional rights alongside the Liberals and Social Democrats, have had enough.\n\nUnder the leadership of Joseph Wirth and Carl Spiecker, the Progressives suddenly split off and reestablished the Zentrum party, now with a new platform of defending the Constitution and people's rights according to the principles of Catholic social teaching. While they will certainly be unable to win more than a handful seats, they may become a maypole of democratic opposition in the following years. Of course, if we even allow it to operate."

 socialist_india_events.13.d:9 "In the summer of 1934 a plan was concocted to further industrialise the city of Agra, with the name chosen for it by the smartest minds in the country simply being the eponymous \"Agra Plan\". Copying ideas first trialled in Britain, it should have been a surefire success, something from which we would already be reaping the benefits, and would continue to do so for years afterwards.\n\nThe entire project quickly devolved into complete disaster, with the labourers assigned to the job failing to accomplish anything of note. Most importantly, one of the chief planners was quickly exposed as embezzling funding, with said exposé having allegedly been organised by the Maximist camp. As the former deputy Chairman was on paper officially in charge of the project, it ended up being one of the last coffins that prompted his resignation.\n\nToday the remaining planners have however approached Huq once again, requesting support to revive the plan in a less official capacity, this time in the city of Ahmadabad. Their primary argument rests on their belief that the plan itself was not flawed, it was simply bad circumstances that led to its failure, and that it can easily succeed in a new location. While the risk to the government here is much less than before, with neither Huq nor Nehru being directly tied to the new plan, repeating the mistakes of the past could easily still see blame throw at Huq. The lower risk does however make the idea tempting, as even a minor success could see dividends for the nation, but it still may of course not be enough to offset the potential damages."

 ireland_events.3.d2:9 "$ireland_events.3.d.start$\n\nToday, word has reached the cabinet from Dublin, that President Collins gave a respectful and solemn speech in recognition of the passing of Ireland's final King. Even as an Irish nationalist and republican, Collins invoked George's legacy of promoting forgiveness and reconciliation, no doubt aimed towards his own politically divided country. Nonetheless, seeing Ireland show such a public display on the King's passing came as a surprise to many."
 ireland_events.12.d1:9 "$ireland_events.12.d$\n\nOvercoming these hurdles, the government's swift and decisive efforts on both fronts appear to have succeeded in bearing fruit. Bailouts for farmers have kept the impact of the loss of revenue from exports under control, the Ulster Democratic Party and the loyalist population remain supportive of the current administration as a bulwark against syndicalism and hardline nationalism, and reports from local canvassers have found that despite the circumstances, support among the Irish people for Sinn Féin remains high.\n\nIn spite of public opinion being generally satisfied with the manner in which Sinn Féin have contained Black Monday, continuing issues regarding the closure of businesses, evictions, unemployment and the recurring issue of the Ulster Privileges continue to be a hot topic in the opposition's speeches and propaganda in preparation for the upcoming elections.\n\nHowever, the government's excellent handling of the crisis means that the scenario of Michael Collins' re-election to the Presidency is now a very likely possibility, and senior deputies of An Saorstáit Críostúil have privately intimated that, should the moment call for it, they could be willing to temporarily cooperate with Sinn Féin and even the UDP for the common good of the Irish Republic."
 ireland_events.12.d2:9 "$ireland_events.12.d$\n\nWhile the government have restored stability to the nation's finances and prevented anarchy in rural areas, a choice which the majority of the Irish people agree was the correct decision, its failure to focus on Ulster to the degree demanded of them by the Ulster Democratic Party has resulted in disturbances within the province, and potentially endangered Sinn Féin's chances of re-election, should the UDP choose to end their confidence-and-supply agreement.\n\nNot only have the UDP grown irritated by the limited support provided to Ulster, with their fear of the abolition of the Ulster Privileges by an alternative administration being the only thing holding back notions of ceasing their support, but, making a bad state of affairs even worse, hardline loyalist and anti-Catholic elements have seized the opportunity to boost their fortunes by accusing the UDP of weakness and encouraging Protestant workers to organise protests and go on strike with the goal of further disrupting the Irish state.\n\nWhile their calls have been listened to only sporadically, and the UDP is tacitly accepting of the slight improvement in the state of the overall economy, it still presents a significant thorn in the government's side in light of Black Monday and the risk of violent clashes between loyalists and the Blueshirts."
 ireland_events.12.d3:9 "$ireland_events.12.d$\n\nWhile the Governmnet succeeded in addressing loyalist clamour and keeping a state of calm within Ulster, despite concerns that the crisis would result in the opening of old wounds, they have been unable to avert the deleterious effects of Black Monday's shockwaves elsewhere on the isle, and as a consequence the administration has been left open to accusations of having put loyalist interests first over the rest of the nation.\n\nThe government's attempts to persuade an infuriated populace that the decision to focus on Ulster was a calculated initiative to protect Ireland's industries, and not merely a move to placate the UDP, have swayed fewer than hoped, and scattered protests have broken out against the government throughout the Irish countryside among large and small farmers alike, angered about the inability of the government to resolve declining rural living standards, and its failure to offer significant subsidies to compensate for their loss of revenue.\n\nThe sporadic outcry has been eagerly fanned by the parties of the opposition, recognising a perfect opportunity to take the reins of the Irish Republic in the wake of what appears to have been a great blunder in the court of public opinion for Sinn Féin. The reality is though, Sinn Féin could have done a lot worse than aiding their supporters in Dáil, and their regime looks to run somewhat smoothly until the next election."
 ireland_events.12.d4:9 "$ireland_events.12.d$\n\nThe government's endeavours in both these regards have ended in failure, with severe repercussions being felt throughout the nation. The UDP has grown disenchanted with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, its position as a big-tent loyalist party under threat from hardliners due to their perceived weakness, and unemployment, declining living standards and crime are on the rise. Opposition parties have avidly fanned the flames of public anger, smelling blood in the water.\n\nAlarmingly for the future of peace on the isle, many have remarked of an upswing in support for Aontas Náisiúnta outside of the party's established strongholds in Munster and predominantly Catholic areas of Ulster, as the dramatic breakdown of pro-German economics, Blueshirt protection of protesting farmers and fears of syndicalist and loyalist upheaval attract surging numbers to their radical proposals.\n\nWithin Sinn Féin itself, whispers of hostility to Collins' leadership are flourishing, his past achievements on behalf of Ireland progressively forgotten in light of his bungling management of the crisis. In the eyes of a growing number of people both in and out of the ruling party, it would appear that the Big Fellow was far better suited as a military man than a statesman."
 ireland_events.12.d5:9 "$ireland_events.12.d$\n\nThe government's failure to do anything with regards to Ulster has exploded in its face, sparking an outbreak of havoc at the most calamitous moment for Ireland's financial recovery. Disturbances have spread like wildfire across the north, worst of all riots in Protestant districts of Belfast and Derry, requiring force from the Gardaí to quell, and a series of bombings, killing several, mostly Catholic, civilians.\n\nThe UDP is simmering with outrage towards the administration, finding itself under severe pressure from hardliners due to their perceived weakness. Their confidence-and-supply agreement is as good as over, holding by a thread only for fear of Aontas Náisiúnta, their leader Eoin O'Duffy now baying for blood over the bombings in speeches given to surging audiences.\n\nCollins' leadership of Sinn Féin lives merely on borrowed time, his legacy forever stained. His foolishly spiteful actions are near-universally condemned even among party faithful, having destroyed any chance of re-election in the foreseeable future and placed the Irish Republic at risk of a return to the economic depression and paramilitary violence that marked Brugha's presidency."

These mounting tensions exploded on the Twelfth itself, as a confrontation broke out while an Orange Order march passed through a Catholic area, escalating into a riot. Gardaí were ineffective at quelling the rioting, with allegations spreading of local Gardaí siding with rioters from their own communities, and by the end of the day several people were dead and many homes destroyed.\n\n"
 ireland_events.1009.d2:9 "$ireland_events.1009.d.start$ While the build up to the Twelfth had always been a tense affair, it was particularly true for this year, as the Blueshirt coup was greeted with much alarm by Ulster loyalists. These tensions erupted in Belfast today as not only did loyalists set off multiple bombs, but several parades devolved into riots as they were blocked by Blueshirts upon attempting to march through Catholic areas. Though the riots were put down with an iron fist, the brutality used only served to alienate Ulster Protestants against the government.\n\nDue to this growing resistance not only from loyalists but also in the south, from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army and pro-democratic elements, O'Duffy and Ó Cuinneagáin have met with the cabinet to discuss how to approach the situation. From the former general's perspective, the issue is domestic, the result of a lack of discipline among the Irish people and demanding the expansion of the Gardai to maintain order, with Protestants to be kept under close watch given their believed inherent disloyalty.\n\nFor Ó Cuinneagáin, the source of the regime's troubles lies abroad with the sinister force of \"Anglo-Syndicalism\" plotting to subvert the Irish nation, and to combat the Red threat a secret police must be established and granted extensive powers to root out via any means, including torture, those traitors willing to take the Saxon shilling. However, such an organisation would be quickly staffed with Blueshirts seeking a more legitimate form of career than their National Guard membership, expanding the integralists' internal influence."

With the Catholic Church and many Sinn Féiners additionally sympathising with the Catholics' plight, Collins, realising the unsustainable nature of the current state of affairs, has attempted to persuade the UDP to accede to concessions, warning that should Sinn Féin lose the next election any new administration's reforms would likely be much more far-reaching and uncompromising.\n\nHowever, his endeavours so far have been met only with hostility from UDP leader Basil Brooke who, in addition to wishing to preserve Protestant power from Catholic encroachment, fears that any loyalist perception of weakness from the UDP would result in an additional loss of seats and influence to other loyalist parties."

These initiatives, however have only served to whip up even more fury in the province, as Catholic Gardaí have proved lenient, while sending in Protestant Gardaí to police marches and prevent Blueshirt activity has provoked outbreaks of violence from enraged Catholics."
 ireland_events.1016.d.scndp:9 "$ireland_events.1016.d.start$\n\nAs it became more apparent that the protest marches were set to continue and stood in the way of economic recovery, the National Development Party's opposition to immediate negotiation on the issue of Ulster had begun to waver. Putting additional strain on the government, the Catholic hierarchy too has expressed its support for the protestors' demands. With pressure mounting but the NDP remaining committed to not provoking loyalist outrage, the coalition proposed a conference with the NLCL, the UDP and Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian religious leaders in hopes of working out a compromise.\n\nWhile all participants agreed to meet, and despite arguing with delegates that if Ireland's religious denominations couldn't work together, the result would be no denominations under syndicalist rule, the negotiations ultimately devolved into sectarian tirades from UDP represenatives and Catholic Archbishop Joseph MacRory, concluding in failure and becoming yet another setback for de Valera."

While the abolition of the article has been met with celebration by the NLCL and the northern Catholic community as a whole given the previous gerrymandering of said boundaries to favour Protestants, the loyalist reaction has been quite the opposite.\n\nFeeling threatened by an imminent loss of Protestant power and by fear that Catholics will take vengeance by engaging in gerrymandering of their own, Protestant communities have seen not only protests and riots but additionally threats issued by the re-established UVF promising insurrection if the government moves to reform the northern constituencies.

However, one of their coalition partners, the National Development Party, popular with the upper class, is reluctant to agree to Labour's proposals for laws against discrimination in hiring, fearful of alienating businessmen.\n\nNonetheless, perceiving that the protest marches stand in the way of Ireland's economy recovery, the NDP agreed with Labour and Clann na Talmhan on the establishment of a council between trade unions and business owners to arrive at a compromise. Unfortunately, negotiations have been slow going, while violence throughout Ulster continue to rise, and fears have risen that circumstances may get out of hand before an arrangement is arrived at."

Ulster Protestant workers have not taken the news gracefully, regarding it as a method by the Catholic and crypto-syndicalist government in Dublin to harm their own employment. To appease Protestants in the bill's wake and lead them away from the lure of militant loyalism, the Labour Party has sought to crack down on the Blueshirts.\n\nUnfortunately, because of Catholic community protection and sympathetic Gardaí, these endeavours have largely failed. While Healy's moderates are grateful for the reforms and have considered a temporary halt to protest marches, many Catholics still continue to hold resentment over the existence of gerrymandering, and Labour's opposition to the Blueshirts has only encouraged bitterness.

They argue our relatively isolated position would make dropping out of the conflicts with Germany's other enemies possible, while we can continue a common struggle against the Internationale.\n\nOf course, as unthinkable as such a proposal is, Ireland's territorial integrity still would remain paramount in such an agreement. That is to say, formal recognition of the fact that Northern Ireland joined the Republic in 1926, as had been previously permitted as part of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 (though few had imagined such a clause would have been enacted).\n\nNonetheless, there are many who will likely see this as a betrayal of Ireland's continental $ireland_events.2006.d.end$"

But what happens in the long run with the American guarantee? Is the arrangement sustainable? Is Ireland to remain hanging on American coat-tails, caught in limbo between the old world and the new, until America decides it has had enough?\n\nIt has emerged that there may now be another course of action. Since [IRE_loc_loas_guarantor] has now begun developing its own military alliance, given the recent and devastating conflicts on the continent, perhaps now is the time to abandon neutrality, and to request full admittance into this new American-led power bloc. It may be in American interests to be able to use Irish land as a military base, and it would also be in their interests for Ireland to develop economically and work with new markets, while they continue rebuilding after their civil war.\n\nAll of this would be a considerable shift of policy for the state, but such are exceptional circumstances, and [IRE_loc_leader_surname] seems determined on his chosen course of action."

Regardless of Ireland being backed up by American arms, the issue of the scourge of international socialism will not go away on its own accord. More must be done to prepare the right-minded nations of the world for the inevitable future conflict with the red menace, and it may be that Ireland is the one to kick it all off.\n\nSince [IRE_loc_loas_guarantor] have now formally created a military alliance, with themselves as the leaders, perhaps now is the time for Ireland to bring itself forward as a possible European vanguard in their fight against socialism. What began as an exercise of American hegemony over the New World could turn into so much more.

This is the fact that the ruling Parliamentary Labour Party would take a very dim view of totalitarianism and authoritarianism of all forms, from both the left and the right, yet the Internationale seem to hold no such discern among its members.\n\nInter-socialist conflict is not without precedent, and evidence of this can be seen by the [IRE_loc_loas_guarantor] electing to form its own alliance, outside of the Internationale.

Subject to wanton pillaging, deceptive landgrabs and the destruction of their native systems of ruling, the Indian people suffered and soon the whole the subcontinent was subjugated by Britain. Just as in Ireland, Britain exacerbated a famine in 1876 through the forced export of food, leading to millions of deaths. Rebellion after rebellion was fought to win their freedom, and though they failed time and time again, they never gave up.\n\nIt is then no surprise that as negotiations for German support of the Easter Rising were underway, Roger Casement expressed support in the German plan for Indian independence, and many Indian nationalists were inspired by Casement's strategy of recruiting prisoners of war to fight for freedom. Figures such as Varahagiri Venkata Giri and Annie Besant were outspoken supporters of Irish independence, and the IRA's own Dan Breen inspired many a Bengali revolutionary with his book \"My Fight for Irish Freedom\".\n\nToday, though India is nominally independent, it lies divided between three competing powers after the collapse of the British Raj. The remnants of the Raj, now granted full Dominion status, seeking stability in their position under Entente and the British Crown. The princes of the south, seeking to maintain their power, have formed into a Federation and though they are no friends of the Dominion, they have been forced into a tacit alliance by a common enemy. Stalled for years in their frozen civil war, the Indian National Congress has attempted to unite India under a socialist republic, and does not intend to give up now.\n\nAs the civil war enters a new phase, several idealistic young Irishmen are considering helping to liberate a former brother in binds, and unite India once again."

 ireland_events.3005.d:9 "As the factional conflicts tearing apart the Aontas Náisiúnta regime from within escalate, the Blueshirts, having assumed the role of a national militia following the March on Dublin, have largely sided with Ó Cuinneagáin, intensifying their training and recruitment in the knowledge that it is only a matter of time before the old guard and the new come to blows. O'Duffy, too, is aware that a final clash is in the offing, and in response he has sought to weaken the influence of the paramilitary organisation he once sponsored, seizing Blueshirt weapons caches and safehouses, further heightening tensions in the process. Both sides have, however, arrived at the realisation that the army, possessing the most manpower and weaponry in the country at their disposal, will ultimately play the part of kingmaker.\n\nThis fact is a setback for the integralist leader, as the ability to demonstrate a connection to Ireland's revolution is an important factor for the officers, and one which Ó Cuinneagáin lacks, having been only a child during the revolutionary period. Though the fact of his youth is not insurmountable given Michael Collins' relatively young age during the war, and Ó Cuinneagáin sharing the military's more Europhile tendencies, it represents a considerable obstacle to gaining their respect.\n\nSeeking to rectify this, Ó Cuinneagáin has reached out to multiple supporters of Aontas Náisiúnta with significant links to the past struggle in order to seek their endorsement. Most notable of these is Dan Breen, one of Ireland's most illustrious war heroes, in addition to several relatives of reknowned Irish martyrs, namely George Noble Plunkett, a Papal count and father of Joseph Plunkett, Kathleen Clarke, the widow of Tom Clarke and Nora Ashe, the sister of hunger striker Thomas Ashe. Should Ó Cuinneagáin be successful in persuading these high-profile men and women to grant him their backing, it would go a long way to winning the army's loyalty and undermining O'Duffy's position."

Complicating matters further is the fact that some northern Catholics also sadly remain wary of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], given their betrayal by liberal democratic West British governments prior to AN's ascendance, and within the community many also sympathise with the traitors rooted out from AN rather than the victors.\n\nIf the administration is not only to live up to its promises of ensuring stability but to truly consolidate its power and be recognised internationally as Ireland's legitimate government without question, then restoring order in the north will be beyond essential. By the carrot and the stick, loyalist insurgents must be subdued, and Ulster's Catholics won over and reassured that AN is looking out for their interests, lest the continuing deterioration of national authority in the province lead to a loyalist rebellion, whose potential success would have devastating results for not only the regime but Ireland as a whole."

The aims of his party remain the same — the complete control of the state and its people — but the initial methods employed have proved more difficult for his opponents to counter than anticipated.

What was once the Progressive Labour Party, now dissolved back into what could be called the \"mainstream\" Labour Party, has its image etched into the new regime, and it is a regime that would seek to unite rather than to divide. The new government has been open with the people, acknowledging the reality of Ireland's new geopolitical alignment, but within reason it has made every effort so far to maintain as many aspects of the old administration as is practicable.\n\nRuling through consensus, the party has negotiated with the ICA, the unions, and old coalition members, including the rump dissidents of the Labour Party, attempting to build tolerance, if not yet support for the new regime. Their immediate aim is to form a new governmental system that works, and that lasts, within the obvious constraint that Ireland is in the Third Internationale.\n\nIn place of nationalist rhetoric and dogmatic ideology, Ireland will attempt to retain the old as well as introduce the new. The more hardline reactionaries must be dealt with decisively, but leniency and discourse with other political opponents will do more than violence could to bring them alongside.

At that time, Ireland had recently signed the Anglo-Irish treaty with the United Kingdom and support for the GAA by the newly independent Ireland was understood to potentially undermine unity in sport. That bifurcation remained in place even after the end of British rule in the north and has continued through until the present. Though the Gaelic Games (and thus the GAA) receive substantial patronage from the government in Dublin, in the interests of maintaining social harmony, the present government of the republic seems certain to continue to uphold that state of affairs."

While some Gaelicists still grumble about his supposed betrayal of Gaelic athletics — it was under his direction that the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was created in mid-1922 to assume authority for non-Gaelic sport — government patronage of the GAA has seen a notable uptick since his rise to unchallenged political authority."
 ireland_flavour_events.386.d3:9 "$ireland_flavour_events.386.d.start$\n\nWhile the fight for political sovereignty was won years ago, the enemy continues to dominate Ireland and its people: foreign games remain popular across the country and even hold a more prestigious place in the minds of many. This sad state of affairs necessitates action and it is apparent that the GAA will be both sword and shield in the struggle for national liberation in athletics. Already, the state has begun to carry out that struggle arm-in-arm with the GAA. Though drastic action has not yet been taken, praise for the GAA and the Gaelic Games has become a common feature of AN rallies and Ó Cuinneagáin's public statements.\n\nA common theme has been frustration with the state of governance of Irish sport. Though the GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally, the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was founded in mid-1922 and maintains authority over many areas of athletics, including those foreign games which ought to be driven from Ireland to begin with. Clearly, a sweeping reorganisation, including the empowerment of the GAA, is long overdue."

In effect, an unspoken agreement came into force between the GAA and [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] whereby each left the other alone to the extent possible. For its part, the Irish Government has continued to lean upon Gaelic sport for legitimacy, eliciting only unofficial grumbling from the organisation's leadership, while the GAA remained independent. However, the GAA seems to have further reconciled itself to the socialist government in recent months, with socialists accepted and elected into various association leadership positions. Ranking GAA members have even appeared alongside government officials at a number of high-profile events, indicating that the GAA is slowly turning a bit pink, if not yet entirely red."

The PLP questions the focus on nationalism and identity itself, and feel that the book omits much work done in social reforms, for the good of Ireland, by the Anglo-Irish.\n\nSuch discussions and commentary themselves are being permitted by the new government, in an effort to normalise their still-unsteady rule, but much work remains in making the people forget that political discourse or normality will never be the same again."

The Guinness family did originally have Gaelic roots, and even if their conversion to Anglicanism can be tolerated, their former loyalty to Britain and ongoing Anglophilic sympathies are considered a nuisance at best, if not quite so apparent as the name of the brand itself. The act of the antecedents of the company's owners to adopt an anglicised version of their surname is one that has personally bothered Ó Cuinnegáin, who has publicly declared his consideration for forcing the company to rename itself or face nationalisation.

Regardless of ownership however, the name of the brand remains, and as it travelled across the British Empire, so shall it travel to workers on all corners of the globe."

 japan_domestic_events.5.d:9 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishūtō in solidarity against the \"white terror\", but this unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social-democratic and syndicalist organisations, united only by their goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had steered the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of his voice, the party was forced to confront the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, the national-syndicalist Nichirōkei (Japan Labour Clique) embraced Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only from within the party - at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) - but also from without, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rōdō Sōdōmei (Japan General Federation of Labour). An open struggle between the two groups soon broke out. The Nichirōkei accused the Sōdōmei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and the Sōdōmei and the Shaminkei in turn accused the Nichirōkei of hijacking labour organisations and turning them into their puppets. Nichirōkei members were expelled from both the Sōdōmei and the Taishūtō earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."

This came after months of planning for the next \"ultimate battleship\" as dubbed by some more than enthusiastic designers, with some designs proposing guns up to 18 inches (46 cm) which would be able to dominate the seas. Dismissed as a pet project and waste of valuable resources and time by the air power advocates, the gun is likely not to see service until it is mounted on its respective ship."
 japan_foreign_events.1.d:9 "Japan has had a presence in Manchuria ever since the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War, and in the years since our hold over the region has greatly strengthened. The negotiations at Shanghai in 1928 forced the world to recognise our right to a 'free hand in Manchuria', opening boundless opportunity to our citizens under the Kwantung Army's watchful eye.\n\nOur control is not absolute however, and Zhang Zuolin's' Fengtian Government is not always cooperative. It is fortunate for him that our desire to safeguard a profitable peace in Manchuria remains paramount, alongside our hope that his government will one day act as a vehicle for our greater Chinese ambitions. For these reasons, the heart of our efforts in Manchuria is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or \"Mantetsu\" for short, which has become responsible for developing and exploiting vast swathes of the Manchurian economy, propelling the region to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soy bean supply.\n\nToday, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."
 japan_foreign_events.206.d:9 "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as \"Anshan Iron and Steel\", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison and the loss of life on the protestors' side.\n\nThe Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions. How should we respond?"
 japan_foreign_events.230.d.taiwan_occupied:9 "Having been utterly vanquished in battlefields across the Asian continent by our victorious armies, the Japanese have retreated from their bases in Manchuria and Korea. Their naval capabilities have similarly been degraded over the years, whether by our actions or by others, leaving them few options to pursue stronger terms. With little hope of challenging our regained supremacy on land, diminishing public opinion and fears of a worsening disaster has forced Tokyo to the negotiating table.\n\nDetermined to save face and cut their losses, they have framed their proposed agreement as necessary to ensure both powers are strong enough to resist Western imperialism. For the most part however, the terms are a recognition of the status quo. Our ownership of Chinese territory will be recognised and all \"leases\" returned, Korea and Taiwan will be relinquished, we will withdraw from any other occupied members of the [JAP.GetFactionName], a non-aggression pact will be signed, and Japan will refrain from further meddling in Chinese affairs.\n\nGiven the logistical challenges of invading Japan proper and other more pressing issues we face than the complete defeat of Japan, the prudent action might be sign this agreement. On the other hand, so long as Japan remains a great power, they are a threat to our territorial integrity, and some hardliners have advised that we push for a total defeat of Japan and the dismantling of the [JAP.GetFactionName] once and for all."

A delegation has been sent to meet with American officials in Honolulu to secure a peaceful transfer of power and our troops landed without a shot fired. While the Americans insist that this is a \"temporary\" measure, this is no doubt a tremendous victory for us in our quest for a greater sphere of influence. However, some in our government have quietly wondered if this is a step too far. What if we've overstretched? And what if the Americans come back for revenge? There's no time for that defeatism now however, Japan is on the move and we will carve out our destiny in Asia!"

Believing his life in danger after this confrontation and hopeful that if not in Ha'il, he may find a listening ear amongst the Ottoman Turks, he travelled to Baghdad where he was allowed passage on a postal plane to the capital. This plane would prove to be his final trip ever as just after refuelling in Mosul, one of his co-passengers threw the prince out of the plane at high altitude.\n\nAlthough no one knows who ordered the attack, word has it in Ha'il that this murder has finally woken up the Emir and prompted him to take decisive action in the matter."

It does not take a genius to recognize that Khiva will never truly serve us as a loyal subordinate, he is a dog who has bit his master once - the only reasonable course of action is to put him down. Instead, the weak governments of Rudnev and Maklakov rewarded this mad dog with recognition of his illegal control over Transcaspia and the abandonment of any real Russian dominion over the Khivans. This embarrassing course of action has been spearheaded by our leading agent in Khiva, the Kornilovite General Ivan Zaytsev, who has “gone native,” aligning himself with Junaid Khan at the expense of his homeland. To rectify these mistakes, we moved to force Zaytsev out, blackmailing him with dubious charges of corruption. He has been replaced with a more trustworthy court advisor, General Vasily Ivanovich Morozov. In response, Junaid Khan has placed General Morozov into glorified house arrest, restricting him from leaving the old city of Khiva or interacting with Russia-sponsored Khiva Military School!\n\nJunaid Khan's brazen acts have threatened to dismember our informal control over the region, and our remaining agents in Khiva report that he intends to strengthen ties with the rogue Turkestani Republic. Without the full support and control of the military, an intervention into Khiva over Junaid Khan's provocations would be dangerous and difficult. Instead, our agents within the Khanate have proposed that we provide clandestine support for the imprisoned Khivan Khan, who, if restored to power through a coup, would certainly prove to be a more pliable puppet. In the meantime, we will have to swallow our pride and ignore the mad dog in Khiva, lest we provide him with any more popular support by acting against him."

They descend from the Latvian Bolsheviks who escaped the failing October Revolution to join their peers in the West, and have returned home to turn Latvia into a model Leninist state.\n\nTo ease the brewing conflict between these two factions, a Constitutional Convention has been called in Valmiera to decide the nature of the new state - without the backing of either one of the main players, however, it is effectively powerless."
 latvia_events.26.d:9 "Following the capture of the city of Riga, Paul Schliemann largely disappeared from the political scene. Now, however, news from Riga tells of the founding of a new liberal political association (not a party to avoid running afoul of current restrictions), \"The Association for National Freedom\", headed up by none other than Schliemann himself. While Schliemann was once a friend of the Letts during the days of German rule over the Baltic, he was certainly still a German and sometimes opposed minority interests in the old Landstag. His new grouping seeks to protect the rights of ethnic minorities, particularly Germans, within Latvia through legal means and publicise their cause internationally. Feelings from within our government are thus mixed. Some wish to crack down on the Association and others to let it be. What should be done?"
 latvia_socialist_events.17.d:9 "Following the Rural Commune acts after the abolition of serfdom in the Baltic provinces, Latvian and Estonian peasantry began to organise into rural communes, known in German as the Landgemeinde, which were granted autonomy, democratic self-government and certain powers as well as privileges. As a result, a generation of peasants in these areas have grown up under largely autonomous and democratic conditions. Participation in the political process and the upkeep of traditional Baltic culture were the norm in these areas, even under wider German domination.\n\nWhile mostly left alone, the election of one Pēteris Briedis as the elder of the Skulte Landsgemeinde, however, caused something of a stir among the Germans. Briedis, an inhabitant of the parish who had at the time moved to Riga to work in its naval dockyards and joined its trade union movement, came to identify as a syndicalist, and was elected by the commune with a political platform focused on the implementation of syndicalism locally.\n\nToday, Comrade Peterss made a high-profile visit to the commune and shook hands with Elder Briedis. The two shook hands in front of cameras operated by the state press and the success of the commune was documented to promote socialism among the people more broadly. Despite the ideological differences between the two men, the image of Peterss and Briedis shaking hands has come to prominence among state propaganda."

Whilst it is currently unclear whether this will have lasting effects on his health, aggravated due to the complete lack of medical personnel in our state, this has emboldened the Idrisi loyalists to call for a vote amongst the Senussi Princes concerning the return of the legitimate heir from his exile in Egypt.\n\nThey are however receiving serious opposition from close friends and commanders of the previous supreme leader, seeing this as nothing but a power-grab by the Princes to enlarge their own influence and push out the last of the loyal pan-Islamists. Led by Umar al-Mukhtār, esteemed war hero of both the Chadian and Italo-Turkish wars, this clique may pose an issue to the Princes if not dealt with adequately."

Prominent commander of the Senussi forces and respected by all, his death comes as a heavy blow in these uncertain times and the ceremony in Ajdabiya attracted a crowd of thousands wishing to wave their hero a final goodbye. Prince Osman Fuad, leader of the Turkish forces in Libya during the Weltkrieg, was quick to send a letter to our government praising his friend and compatriot whilst in Kostantiniye the Chamber of Deputies showered his valiant deeds during the war with the highest praise.\n\nWith the death of the most prominent defender of the sickly Ibrahim, it seems unlikely anyone will stand in the way of a return to power by Idris. Some stragglers in the opposition remain however, pointing out how odd the sudden death of their leader was and accusing the supporters of Idris of poisoning. As Muslim tradition however forbids delayed funerals, they have no way to acquire proof of this supposed plot."

However due to lack of finances, Xu wouldn't be able to continue his schooling.

During the Xinhai Revolution, Xu would join his fellow revolutionaries and fight in a student battalion.\n\nApplying for the Baoding Military Academy post-Xinhai in 1914, Xu would study infantry in the 3rd Class of the academy and be a classmate of Bai Chongxi. Graduating in 1916, Xu would soon become an officer, being admitted to the 6th Class of the Staff College in 1919, and graduating 3 years later. Assigned to the 1st Regiment of the 1st Division of the Zhejiang Army, he would be promoted in 1926 to commander of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade.\n\nOnce second only to Sun Chuanfang in Jinling Military Academy's staff, he was assigned to the 1st Division under Chen Yi. Seeing fierce fighting in the Northern Expedition, Xu remained steadfast on the frontlines.

The Mongol princes play a large part in our government, and we received large amounts of wealth from taxes on their land and wealth. It is likely the princes are fearful of the Western Revolt, with it being a threat to their power. However, perhaps there is something more to this. Prince Demchugdongrub has not made it a secret that he believes Ungern's stewardship of the regency has caused numerous flagging issues. Whether he intends to push for Ungern's replacement, or continue to support him, insofar as the Baron is concerned, it is undecipherable at the present."
 mongolia_events.13.d:9 "With the Western Revolt in full swing, and rebels controlling key cities in the region, most of the army and senior military commanders have been forced to leave Urga. The modern Mongolian army is dominated at higher levels with Russian staff, who hold extreme loyalty to Ungern and are members of his informal RVK. The loyalty of these key army figures is one of the main reasons Ungern was able to remain influential, besides the consent from the 1st Bogd Khan.\n\nThe issue for Ungern is obvious. With most of the RVK leaving Urga to deal with the west, opposing political factions are finally seeing their chance to act. The Mongol Ardīn Nam have always had a strong presence in Urga, and there are rumours that many senior MAN officials like Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj and Anandyn Amar have travelled to the city. Both the Buddyn Zövlöl and the Mongol princes hold great influence in our government, and both stand ready to take over if given the chance. Ungern must walk a fine line between the factions if he is to survive the next few months..."
 mongolia_events.103.d:9 "News from Moscow: Viktor Chernov, current Leader of the Opposition, has been shot dead in the Senate. During the tenure of his predecessors, we were able to broker many economic and military deals, allowing our extremely weak economy to grow - deals that were maintained by the current President Boris Savinkov out of pragmatism. Although regretfully Chernov and his ilk, the Socialist Revolutionaries, are closet Bolsheviks, they nonetheless kept the \"Vozhd\" contained insofar as to not cut Russia's benevolent agreements with Mongolia.\n\nHowever, the present situation has brought a lot of our position into question. A political assassination of such a high-ranking politician is likely to throw Russia's politics even further down the drain, perhaps cementing Savinkov's rule as the opposition collapses. With the Russian government now rather focused on its own political struggles, it seems we have been forgotten. There are worrying signs that we might lose the Russian support that our nation has become dependent on."
 mongolia_events.107.d:9 "Jamsrangiin Tseveen has been a high ranking member of the MAN for many years, after working in universities in Siberia. He even organised and distributed the first newspaper in Mongolia. However, he has always ranked on the more right wing of the party. On multiple occasions he has argued with Soliin Danzan, and other high ranking MAN members. It is, therefore, no surprise that Tseveen has decided to split from the party, citing the recent leadership struggle as evidence of the party's corruption. His popularity and intelligence cannot be underestimated."
 mongolia_events.122.t:9 "Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj makes a speech in Urga"
 mongolia_events.122.d:9 "\"People of Mongolia. Finally, we are free! The dictatorship of the Russian dog Ungern-Sternberg has come to an end, and his death squads have been driven from the nation. No longer shall we live under a dictator, no longer shall we live under foreign control, no longer shall we be slaves!\"\n\nTseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj's speech, held outside the State Great Khural in Urga, went on for almost an hour, talking in detail about the serious reforms the new government was going to make; he promised the redistribution of wealth, a real constitution, and democratic elections. Even though the speech went on for so long the audience was captivated all the way. Nearly every other sentence of Dambadorj was met with cheers and thunderous applause from the crowd."
 mongolia_events.131.t:9 "Amar Questions Dambadorj's Loyalty"
 mongolia_events.131.d:9 "In a speech in the recently empowered State Great Khural, Anandyn Amar, member of the MAN, held a speech questioning the current leadership. In this speech, he claimed that Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj has lead the MAN through nepotism, and that Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj is nothing more than a spy for the Japanese. Though these comments were very controversial, due to Amar's support in the party, we will have to let this slide for now."
 mongolia_events.132.t:9 "Radical Ideas in the Party"
 mongolia_events.132.d:9 "With our power recently elevated to the nation stage, the party has begun to split in terms of policy. In the past, the party's only goal had been gaining power. Now, the ideological divides of the party are beginning to show. The party is generally split between the more moderate members, led by Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, and the more radical members, led by Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir and Ölziin Badrakh. Anandyn Amar commands his own clique in the party, made up of less radical leftists and the stronger Mongol nationalists. Though this group of radicals is still a minor force in the party, it destabilises our leadership in a time when we sorely need stability. They also have made it clear that they are willing to give their support to Anandyn Amar, if he should need it against Dambadorj."
 mongolia_events.133.t:9 "Chagdarjav Begins Investigating Dambadorj"
 mongolia_events.133.d:9 "Dambyn Chagdarjav was one of the men who founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam, with Dogsomyn Bodoo and others. Though Chagdarjav has been colleagues for many years with DAmbadorj, it has not stopped the two from battling for power for control of the party, a battle Dambadorj won. Chagdarjav was almost purged from the party, along with his co-conspirator Dogsomyn Bodoo, however, Dambadorj decided to pardon the men, due to the extremely weak position the MAN were in after another failed revolution, and his familial connection with Bodoo.\n\nHowever, it appears Chagdarjav is back to his old tricks. Today, he announced to the party that he was going to begin an investigation of Dambadorj into any \"ties to foreign enemies\". Of course, this investigation will surely amount to nothing."
 mongolia_events.134.t:9 "Elbegdorj Argues with Dambadorj"
 mongolia_events.134.d:9 "Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, a leader of the left wing of the party and friend of Anandyn Amar, recently got into an argument with Prime Minister Dambadorj about socialism. Elbegdorj, in front of many other party members, openly stated that the transition to socialism was taking far too long under Dambadorj, and that perhaps Dambadorj is not entirely loyal to the Mongolian State. Dambadorj, of course, argued back that the transition was happening as fast as was possible, and that the left wing policies of Elbegdorj were dangerous for the party. This seemed to stir much anger against Dambadorj, with multiple other leftist party members joined in at arguing with Dambadorj. It seems party unity is worse than imagined."
 mongolia_events.135.d:9 "Recently, thanks to one of our spies in Amar's clique, we discovered a meeting between Amar and Dambyn Chagdarjav, who is still currently investigating Dambadorj over his foreign ties. Apparently, the meeting lasted for multiple hours, with Amar himself stating it was \"very productive\"."

 mongolia_events.137.t:9 "Chagdarjav comes out with evidence of Dambadorj bypassing laws for Russian companies"
 mongolia_events.137.d:9 "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he states that he recently discovered a deal between Dambadorj and a Russian businessman, where Dambadorj took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. His report was also filled with much evidence, showing that perhaps that Russian businessman was in fact working for Chagdarjav against Dambadorj! Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj has made no response to the claims as of yet. The next meeting of the State Great Khural, scheduled for tomorrow, will definitely be an eventful one."
 mongolia_events.138.t:9 "Anandyn Amar and Elbegdorj coup Dambadorj"
 mongolia_events.138.d:9 "In the Great State Khural today, Anandyn Amar, flanked either side by Rinchingiin Elbegdorj and Dambyn Chagdarjav, made a speech damning Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, citing the report Chagdarjav released just yesterday. As his speech went on, members of the Great State Khural began to yell and shout about \"Dambadorj the Traitor\" and \"Dambadorj the Russian\". After many minutes of this, Dambadorj attempted to leave, but upon standing was met by two armed guards, who seized Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj and put him in handcuffs. From there, Dambadorj was taken into a private police room for \"questioning\". In the State Great Khural, with his coup a success, Anandyn Amar announced that a vote will be held to decide who in the party should become the next prime minister. No one other than Amar stood for the role, and so he won a unanimous victory."
 mongolia_events.139.t:9 "Chagdarjav Releases Evidence of Dambadorj Corruption"
 mongolia_events.139.d:9 "Dambyn Chagdarjav has today concluded his investigation on Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, finding that he in fact did have dangerous links to foreign business. In his report, he claims that he recently discovered a deal between Dambadorj and a Russian businessman, where Dambadorj took a bribe to allow the immediate construction of a new factory in Urga, bypassing the rest of the government to fill his own coffers. However, there is a serious lack of evidence in the report, with some party members suspicious whether this is all faked or not. Dambadorj has come out against these claims, stating that though he was contacted by a Russian businessman recently, he declined the bribe and sent the man away. It has become obvious what this is: a grab for power against Dambadorj. Though we can have Chagdarjav arrested for his fake claims, it will show us as dictators. What may be best is if we get Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, currently a neutral member of the MAN, to investigate these claims himself, to show that we are a just society."
 mongolia_events.141.d:9 "Following the successful arrest of Dambyn Chagdarjav, following his fake claims against Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, Anandyn Amar and Rinchingiin Elbegdorj were seen this morning fleeing the capital, fearing their own arrest. From some of our reports, they plan to lay low for a few weeks in a small village nearby, while the heat around them dies down. With this, it seems Dambadorj's power is secure."
 MON_darizavyn_losol_advisor_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §LApril 15th, 1890, in Daiqingbeizi Banner, Chechen League, Outer Mongolia, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSent to a local monastery at the age of 9 in order to become a monk, Losol would advance to Gandan Monastery in the capital, Khüree, at the age of 12. Studying there for 6 years, Losol would take on his education with a sense of tenacity and hunger. Studying languages and devouring religious texts, Losol would travel abroad in 1908, driven by his desire to learn. Utilising the Manchurian railway, Losol would travel to Beijing. From there, he would pass through Buryatia, and then onwards to Petrograd and Moscow. Influenced by the Xinhai Revolution and the liberalisation occuring within Russia, he would return to Mongolia just at the right juncture to see the Bogd Khanate established.\n\nServing as a lama in the army of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren, the occupation of the Chinese would see Losol join the Züün Khüree, becoming one of the \"First Seven\". Joining Sükhbaatar, Dogsom, and Choibalsan in Russia, Losol would attend the First Congress of the Mongolian People's Party, being elected to its Central Committee. Seeing service in the failed MAN revolutions, Losol would slowly accumulate influence within the party in the interim. Utilising his connections with the Seven, and with the young guard, Losol would be elected the party's Chairman.\n\nNow seeing his revolutionary party finally take the reigns of power in Mongolia, Losol's priorities are divided. With his own party conducting machinations in lieu of his position, it would appear that Losol's struggle is not over yet.§!"
 MON_dambyn_chagdarjav_bio:9 "Numbering amongst one of the First Seven Mongolian Revolutionaries, and a close associate of Dogsomyn Bodoo, Dambyn Chagdarjav is but an aloof presence amongst hardened revolutionaries. The first Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government in Exile, and before that a well-travelled Lama and Merchant, Chagdarjav's career would start similarly to many fellow middle-class Bureaucrats: in the Provisional Government.\n\nAs an early clerk and wise businessman, Chagdarjav would become the Minister of Finance in the Bogd Khanate, founding the Mongolian Mutual Aid Co-Operative and serving as an ally of many of the lay nobility. Taking part in the Kyakhta Conference of 1915, he would resign in opposition to the ensuing Treaty, thus travelling abroad to Britain, Italy, and Russia from 1916 to 1917.\n\nReturning to Mongolia in a time of great struggle, Chagdarjav would finance and aid in the founding of the Consular Hill Group with Bodoo, Choibalsan, and Losol. Pivotal, and an eccentric, Chagdarjav has stayed ably at Bodoo's side ever since 1921, and is commonly regarded as his Second-in-Command."

 MON_tseren_ochiryn_dambadorj_bio:9 "The \"Green Herdsman\" of the Mongolian People's Party, Dambadorj is an infamous name within inner party circles. Attending a Manchu and Russian interpreter's school in the capital before moving onto a Russian gymnasium and secondary school in Troitskosavsk, eventually attaining a job as a telegraph operator. Joining the Mongolian People's Party in 1921, he would join the People's Regular Army at the same time, and then serving as a member of the Central Committee and secretary of the Party. Appointed by the People's Provisional Government as the representative officer of the North-West Region, he would be seriously wounded in a battle with the white army.\n\nNot one to sit idly, Dambadorj began to construct an elaborate media empire using his natural charisma and orating skills, championing the cause of the revolution to the masses. Unfortunately, it would all be for naught, as the minds of the people stand very little against the tide of the Baron's bullets. Choosing exile in Russia over a guerrilla war in the wastes of the desert, Dambadorj would continue running his (now illegal) media campaigns on behalf of the party, managing to secure ties with various nobles, lamas, peasant leaders, and even that of Magsarjav.\n\nNoticing the astonishing rise in influence of Boris Savinkov, and the tactics of his Soyuz Zashchity Rodiny i Svobody, or SZRS, Dambadorj studied their efforts intently, hoping to emulate them in his native Mongolia. For what Mongolia needs is a party of the peasantry and for all Mongols, one that is utterly indispensable, and one focused on securing Mongolia from all threats."

 nicaragua_events.6.d:9 "Violence, even when committed in the name of a righteous cause, is unacceptable when directed against our own nation and people. The actions of those few who would lower themselves to such behaviour are slowly but surely ripping our country apart, distracting us from the true goal of spreading the revolution to Central America, and freeing our brethren around the world. I beseech all who have even a shred of dignity for a return to peace!'\n\nThe Sandinistas have ceased to engage in political violence."
 nicaragua_events.7.d:9 "For four years now, Sequeira has been on a tour of the countryside and our nation's most isolated rural villages. Although the revolution has precipitated a significant rise in his social status, he remains a source of great pride and standard to aspire to for the peasantry who see him as one of their own. His popularity has risen slowly but steadily over the years thanks in part to his activity in the countryside, and he has now managed to position himself as a new compromise candidate between Sandino and Sacasa. The nation holds its breath in anticipation of his full entry in the race."
 nicaragua_events.41.d:9 "It has begun. The growing unrest in the United States has officially erupted, with the American giant completely collapsing upon itself. The status quo of the region is also quickly falling apart without the watch of the giant and in this chaos, 'aligning' our northern neighbour is our first priority. Combined, we will be able to stand up to El Salvador and Guatermala's massive population and industry and bring a new age of liberty to the region."
 nicaragua_events.53.d:9 "In a move to establish true democracy, Sacasa has invited formally exiled president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas back to Nicaragua. Chamorro is technically the start of the 1926 revolution, as he couped the elected president, causing him to be deposed by the United States and putting Adolfo Díaz in power. Sacasa served as vice-president during this, causing him to have good relations with Chamorro. Sacasa's main worry since his revolution is people thinking he is leading a dictatorship due to the lack of an opposition party and the people turning on him, so a small amount of opposition would increase his opinion among the people."
 nicaragua_events.54.d:9 "Sacasa today has announced new elections in a month following the recent revolution. So far, the political chances of Sacasa being removed from the presidency seem minimal to none, but the invitation of Chamorro to the country could see a shakeup to the current liberal dominance within the country."
 nicaragua_events.55.d:9 "The invitation of Chamorro to the country has had somewhat predictable results, as he has to decided to reform the Conservative Party from the '20s under his leadership as a bid for the presidency. The party includes some former presidents and those who opposed Sandino during the revolution. So far the party has gotten moderate response from those who hold a grudge against Sacasa for the removal of the socialists and small traction in the capital. The chances of them winning the election are not the highest, but a turnaround in attitude could easily occur depending on how each party campaigns."
 nicaragua_events.59.d:9 "As the guard continues to grow and develop, Chamorro has found himself getting increasingly involved within it following his loss in the election, wanting to contribute something to the country. This has led to disputes between the current head of the guard Cuadra and Chamorro himself on the direction to take it. Cuadra wants it to be a strong, offensive force built upon trying to overthrow the dictatorships within America while Chamorro wants to make it a force built upon defending Nicaragua and its people. Due to the very little common ground between them, we'll have to side with one over the other."
 nicaragua_events.59.b:9 "Chamorro knows what Nicaragua needs."
 nicaragua_economy_events.1.d:9 "Nicaragua, despite its size and variety of products, is generally known as the poorest country within Central America. Constant crisis, military occupation by the United States, and the subsequent revolution left our country dry, largely exportless, and caused it to enter a subsequent recovery phase.\n\nWith our reliance on the United States already removed by the time they stopped buying products from us after the revolution, we've been left desperately looking for new partners. While there are many countries which could prove to be beneficial partners, we'll need to be constantly aware of the United States one day knocking on our doorstep again, stronger than ever."
 nicaragua_economy_events.2.d:9 "The absence of the United States from our country's picture has left us with many opportunities, despite our initial weakness. We can now begin to forge our own future economically, one where are no longer reliant on the United States for exports, and we can now advertise to a broader market. This has brought up the 'Revolutionary Economy Plan' within our government, focused on increasing domestic industry within the country, bringing in new trade partners, and increasing economic self-dependency, even if only slightly. The plan has officially been employed, but how the plan will go is still unknown to many."
 nicaragua_economy_events.3.d:9 "Our currently Socialist government is seen as a threat to governments like Germany and Canada, sadly leaving us unable to touch their markets. However, there are many partners within Europe, like the Commune of France and Union of Britain which would be willing to invest in our country due to our friendly ties. The Commune of France would mainly be interested in seeing us be able to defend ourselves against the Americans should they ever become a threat, while the Union of Britain would most likely be interested in seeing our economy grow to increase our many exports. Who should we choose to ask for assistance from?"

Seemingly the entire Middle East had taken up arms against Kostantiniye, and back then, hopes were high that this war would be over quick, with overwhelming numbers working in our favour and the decadent Ottoman Empire simply collapsing under its own weight. But now, the situation is looking dire.\n\nNews has just reached [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] that, with Teheran and other major [FROM.GetAdjective] cities having fallen to the advancing Ottoman forces, [FROM.GetNameDef] has officially surrendered to the Sublime Porte. With that, our closest allies, and by extension the Tabriz Accords, are no more. And now, we stand alone against an overwhelming enemy.\n\nStill, surrender is not an option. The Ottomans would accept nothing but the total annihilation of our nation - and we simply cannot allow that to happen.

 philippines_political_events.040.d.PHI:9 "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nFor the Philippines, this situation presents both an opportunity and a risk. Aligning with a power provides benefits but will also earn the enmity of its opponent. Some incline towards Japan, with its vision of Pan-Asian cooperation and the end of Western imperialism. Others point towards Germany, still the world's hegemon and guardian of the present order. Still more advocate keeping distance from both Japan and Germany, though under present circumstances this will likely prove a challenge. Not a few quietly curse the withdrawal of the Americans, and hope against hope that the US, colonial master though it was, may someday recover its strength."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.GER:9 "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe Philippines was never much on Germany's radar. Though there is a respectable German commercial presence in the country, the Kaiserreich was happy to recognise America's hegemony over the islands, and focused on preserving its Asian presence through cooperation with British and Dutch colonial officials while establishing relations with independent Asian states like Siam and Burma. Now that a new Asian state has arrived on the scene, we may want to continue this practice with the newly independent Filipino government. If for no other reason, we should strive to get Manila on our side before Tokyo can."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.JAP:9 "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe Philippines have long been a thorn in Japan's side. It was the centre of American influence and military strength in the region, both of which were long considered by Tokyo as a potential threat to the growing power of the Japanese Empire as well as a disgusting display of Western imperialism. With the Americans gone, however, the situation has changed. The Philippines lay unaligned, but are already a major Japanese trade partner and hosting a sizable Japanese population. An alliance with the Philippines would greatly extend Japanese power to the south. If for no other reason, we should strive to get Manila on our side before Berlin can."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.USA:9 "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe withdrawal from the Philippines was a sad day for the United States. Even though the relationship between the two countries was that of master and subject, there was also a genuine friendship between many Americans and Filipinos. As American forces left, they were often (privately) told by Filipino leaders that the Philippines would be open to realignment with the United States once the present civil unrest were over. With the worst of the war behind us, the opportunity of reasserting our power in the Western Pacific presents itself. But Germany and Japan have been vying for influence in Manila while we've been away, and we need to catch up- fast."

 poland_flavour_events.44.d:9 "News has reached the administration in Warsaw over an internal conflict within the \"Old Catholic Mariavite Church\" based in Płock. Ever since its founder, Sister Maria Kozłowska, perceived by them as a saint, passed away in 1921, the Church was headed by Archbishop Jan Maria Kowalski. The Archbishop's reforms, which he called \"understandings\" were controversial to say the least. First was the introduction of Holy Communion under both kinds during the anniversary of the founder's death, followed by removing the celibate and introduction of so-called \"Priestly Sisters\", with one of them even becoming a Bishop. As a result of these reforms, many have left this denomination and rejoined the Roman Catholic Church. However some wanted to remain within the Church, but remove the problematic Archbishop.\n\nAs such, two meetings of the church elders were called, which ended with removal of the Archbishop Kowalski, forced renouncing of his goods and relocation from Płock to nearby Felicjanów. Archbishop Jan Maria conceded and moved to Felicjanów with a circle of his followers, but soon after, they called the proceedings of the elders illegal, claiming that the spiritual leader cannot be removed, but can only resign. This decision caused a split in the Church, which ended up with most followers remaining loyal to \"Płock Denomination\", however many left the church altogether.\n\nAfter the split, the \"Płock Denomination\" would keep the name of \"Old Catholic Mariavite Church\", while the \"Felicjanów Denomination\" would go back to the first original name of the Church, \"The Catholic Mariavite Church\". Soon after, Archbishop Jan Maria was imprisoned after an appeal from the leader of Płock Mariavites, Bishop Klemens Maria Feldman, who also called on the local government to secure the Felicjanów assets, to \"prevent them from being plundered by other Mariavite sisters\"."

Caring for the people, he was fair and compliant, and would experience military combat for the first time in suppressing local bandits.\n\nWith Tan Yankai personally recruiting Zhang Qihuang to organise his military, Zhang would resign following Yuan Shikai's own inquiries into his skillset in 1914.

 qing_focus_events.3.d:9 "Riding off the wave of patriotism with our resounding support of Chen Tiaoyuan's Anti-Concessionist movement, we have taken the first brave step in ridding the Chinese nation of incessant foreign imperialists and their vile colonial bureaucrats. A cross-national movement experiencing bounds of support from the populace in Guangdong, Shandong, Yunnan, and rather obviously the League territories, various Beiyang politicians close to the Cabinet and President such as Yuan Naikuan, Yuan Shikai's Steward and assistant in Cao Kun's ascension to the President, and that of Bian Shoujing, Speaker of the Assembly have suggested that the President should call forth a variety of new elections to capture this popular sentiment.\n\nConferring with Marshal Wu, exceedingly supportive of the movement, the President declared a new national election to be held across all territories under presumptious control of the Central Government. Theoretically, all literate men in China are eligible to participate but due to local interference, gentry control, warlords and revolutionary movements abound, it is likely expected that the only results to be received will be from the Central Plains. An unfortunate circumstance but nonetheless beneficial for maintenance of our rule.\n\nWith previous elections having seen razor-thin margins, boycotts and other upheaval, and with the body unlikely to shift the dominance of the Harmony Association due to the sheer number of seats under our control, it will nonetheless improve our legitimacy in the long run. Many decry the Beiyang Republic and Assembly as a mere powerless body ruled by autocrats and strongmen, but we can display a true, thriving, Chinese democracy!"
 qing_flavour_events.25.d:9 "With the maintenance and continuation of our special relationship with the German Empire, our major urban cities have seen a resounding influx of capital and finance, with endeavouring German business hoping to make a fortune in the wake of Black Monday. With an explosion of German factory construction following our relaxation of international investment laws, this has brought immense benefit to our economy, allowing free trade between increasingly equal partners.\n\nYet the foreigners are never satisfied, always looking for ways to skirt regulations and laws for even the most marginal increase in revenues. Engaging in somewhat dubious business practices, a number of them have no doubt begun to flagrantly abuse China's abundant labour and manpower pools, contrasting with those in Mitteleuropa.\n\nEarlier this morning, the Cabinet assembled to deal with a minor scandal that had erupted, regarding the discovery that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay. Even worse, the factory had cut a deal with the local police to arrest and intimidate any worker who complained or made a formal protest, making the local provincial government appear little more than foreign stooges."
 qing_flavour_events.13.d_hu:9 "$qing_flavour_events.13.intro$\n\nRather uncomfortable in such large gatherings like this, President Hu Shih opted to segregate himself to his study, only allowing Jiang Baili and Wang Chonghui as company as the various other celebrants entertained themselves over pool and light political alongside military discussion. Discussing politics, current events, and the current state of the world, the three men rejoiced over a friendly game of cards.\n\nEnquired as to if he really believes he can uproot the Zhili Clique by Wang, Hu reflected for but a moment. Playing a great hand, and winning the pot from both men, he but merely gazed longingly outside the window. \"A titanic task, but something entirely within our limits, no?\". With general agreement across all parties, the men continued their game, long into the night. Undisturbed by the machinations of the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding.\n\nHaving also sequestered themselves from the rest of the party goers, the master and the protégé merely discussed all that they could not whilst in their respective roles. Considering the circumstances, Wu and Cao mused over the independent nature of Hu Shih and his reformists, the Jade Marshal all too aware that he has to keep the \"Lone Idealist\" in-check."
 qing_flavour_events.13.d_koo:9 "$qing_flavour_events.13.intro$\n\nIn his element, having frequently went to expensive and lavish dinners during his time as a diplomat to multiple countries, Wellington Koo and his wife entertained their guests with stories of his missions to foreign countries, and of gossip from within Beijing's inner circles, much to the dismay of the Jade Marshal and Cao Kun, frequent subjects of these stories.\n\nWith Madame Wellington Koo far outshining her husband, she recalled a story relating to the Old Marshal, Zhang Zuolin. \"Zhang Zuolin adhered strictly to old-fashioned Chinese customs. He never invited women to his own entertainments, nor would he allow them at any private parties he attended. In public, he merely bowed to women, then ignored them. One evening during a benefit theatrical performance at which the diplomatic corps was present, Madame Zhang and I sat together. I was introduced to General Sun Chuanfang, who was seated near by. Seeing I had no programme he rose and courteously handed me his. The Old Marshal was quite piqued by the general's politeness. \"I never knew you to curry favour with ladies,\" he remarked tartly.\"\n\nGarnering much laughter from the company at the party, it was evidently clear that Madame Koo was the life of the party, not her husband. Instead opting to play cards on his own with the Jade Marshal, the duo discussed their future, with Koo expected to be the likable face for what was really Wu Peifu's government."
 qing_flavour_events.106.d:9 "Split upon the precipice of Federalism and Centralism, the Chinese Republic has been marred by such a conflict for decades. Disregarding Revolutionaries, as their time has undoubtedly passed, the traditional North-South split can also be viewed in the lense of that of a Centralist-Federalist split. Of course, notable Federalists and Centralists exist on both sides, however with the likes of Zhang Zuolin, Wu Peifu and Cao Kun in the North contrasting with Tang Jiyao, Zhao Hengti and Chen Jiongming in the South, their numbers are dwarfed by the titans of their respective movements. Yet there was always an essence of reconciliation, an attempt to bridge the divide. In specific regards to the Jade Marshal, he has been approached by the Federalists numerous times to unite the nation.\n\nOriginally spurned on by the likes of Hu Shih, Wu Peifu originally envisioned the role of \"China's Hamilton and Franklin\", the Parliamentarians, to ensure that the state centralise power to itself, and distribute it amongst the people. Disagreements would arrive as Hu Shih's Federalist ideas, the ideal of provincial autonomy and self-governance, clashed with Wu's primacy of the Beijing Government, questioning the capacity to delegate power amongst the people if the provinces and local councils cannot retain power themselves. Fearing, misunderstanding, that Wu was merely delaying self-governance to preserve his rule and prevent democracy, he would be unaware that Wu's insistence on building a centralised unitary state was not due to a warlord's desire to maintain the power of his guns, nor as a repudiation of democratic principles.\n\nAs a persistent champion of the people's will to exert themselves in discussing and deciding national affairs, Wu passionately advocates for popular political participation. Not concered about granting political rights, Wu merely draws fears from delegating political autonomy to the provinces. In-fact such a stance was perhaps the largest obstacle to unification in the 1920s, and even now remains a severe obstacle."
 qing_foreign_policy_events.104.d:9 "Hunan Province had fallen under the sway of Sun Chuanfang during the chaos following the 1927 Northern Expedition, with Governor Zhao Hengti re-assuming control of the province after a brief period of KMT rule. Considered by some to be an outlier within the Zhili camp due to strong Federalist sympathies, nevertheless Zhao is a long time personal friend of Wu, having been restored to the Governorship by the Jade Marshal.\n\nDespite this, Wu also saw to it that the previous Hunan Governor, and close Zhili afficianado, Tang Xiangming, be granted a personal fiefdom within Yueyang, a city situated upon the Zhili-Hunan border. Alongside Tang Xiangming, the defection of Old Guizhou Clique ringleader Yuan Zuming during the Northern Expedition has granted the Marshal another lever to tug in his favour.\n\nWith the ensuing collapse of the League, Zhao has taken an outwardly neutral stance towards political alignments, however, should that be his folly, Tang Xiangming might be inclined to act. His neutrality cannot last long, for with the announcement of Hunan's Provincial Governor elections, clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."

This is almost definitely a pointed threat to ally with [FNG.GetLeader] in Fengtian, a challenge to our rule in the northern part of the nation and risking the reigniting of conflict. Sandwiched between both factions, while we are still favoured to defeat both in a conflict like we did in the 1920s, it would likely leave our southern flank exposed to developments in the south."
 qing_foreign_policy_events.26.d.nofengtian:9 "$qing_foreign_policy_events.26.intro$\n\nThe demise of Zhang Zuolin has lessened this threat considerably, however we ought to be at least somewhat cautious nonetheless.

 qing_foreign_policy_events.27.d.fengtian:9 "$qing_foreign_policy_events.27.d.nofengtian$\n\nAnother option available to us would be to enlist the support of the [FNG.GetName]. Ruled by the ambitious warlord [FNG.GetLeader], the Yan clique has previously worked with them to disastrous results in 1928 hoping to topple the Zhili clique in their moment of weakness. This is how we lost control of Eastern Shanxi in the first place, and many are not eager to cast their lots with them again. However, alone we are unlikely to be much of a match for the central army. Still, siding with them will mean depending on them for a successful outcome, and should they not come through we will be forced to back down."
 qing_foreign_policy_events.92.d:9 "Despite our victorious entry through the Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in the Great Wall and their utter rout to the Dai River, the [QIE.GetAdjective] high command has been slow to acknowledge their defeat. Either because of poor communication or general incompetence or because of a stubborn desire to see the Guominjun destroyed in the Central Plains, their response has been lumbering and ineffectual - leaving major gaps across the river which had become a natural boundary of sorts.\n\nThough our own high command was satisfied with the outcome and reluctant to press forward, scouting parties probing the area were more ambitious. Soon enough, they came across multiple lightly (or in some cases unguarded even) access points and soon enough bridgeheads were made. It quickly became a mad dash by overeager officers trying to claim they were first in reaching Beijing. As men finally reached the outskirts of the city local police belatedly started firing back from fortified positions, forcing a halt. Fearing overextension orders from on high cut back any further advances. As Beijing is within eyeshot of the new Fengtian border it remains to be seen how long until the Grand Marshal orders it's capture."
 qing_foreign_policy_events.60.d:9 "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Zhili enterprises to do business in the new League. Yet the scars wrought by Sun Chuanfang's nightmare run deep, and are everlasting. Resulting in a backwards, bureaucratic hellhole despite Chen's reforms. With this, our attempts to flood League markets with Northern goods and businessmen are proving quite difficult.\n\nHowever, when the Liaison Council recently requested League-Marshal Chen to enable the Central Government to have authority in the management of the League's internal bureaucry, they rebuffed our request, stating that such measures are rather untenable at the present moment. The gall of this petty warlord to refuse the likes of the President and his Marshals? Let President Cao inform League-Marshal Chen that he was not merely asking, he is demanding."

Designed by architect Nicolae Nenciulescu with heavy involvement from the King and the Queen Mother Maria, the new Palace stands as a monumental reminder of the splendour of King Carol's reign, with his Royal cypher prominently decorating many elements of the construction.\n\nBucharest will continue experiencing various beatifications and repairs as a result of the new wave of constructions ushered by the palace's construction, and the royals themselves have appeared pleased with how the edifice has turned out. The new structure will be the official residence of the Romanian monarchy, although the Royal family themselves have also had a smaller villa built on the premises, known as the \"New House\", in order to have some privacy every once in a while."
 romania_events.159.d:9 "In spite of having to tackle the additional responsibilities of governance in addition to having to lead the Legionary Movement, the \"Captain\", Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, has found enough time in his schedule to work on a new book; a volume that is part autobiography, part ideological manifesto.\n\nTitled For My Legionaries, the book tells the story of its founder's life from a fatidic oath in a forest around Husi to his first forays into Parliament and assumption of the Prime Ministerial office, heavily interspersed with its author's musings on a host of topics from the role of the monarchy to that of the nation as a whole. Written in a relatively curt, diary-like style spiced with various speeches, article quotations, letters and Bible passages, it proved to be very popular once published, with its first edition selling out in a few weeks (the 2500 free examples distributed to members who could not afford it notwithstanding), and demand for a new one gradually going up.\n\nThe Prime Minister himself was surprised by the speed with which his volume flew off the shelves, and was said to have entered talks to have new editions published, with more ambitious voices claiming it will also be translated into foreign languages soon enough."
 romania_events.160.d:9 "The eminent professor and sociologist Dimitrie Gusti has added yet another success to his career recently with the publication of the first volume of his newest project, The Encyclopaedia of Romania.\n\nCoordinated by him and contributed to by various high-ranking Romanian intellectuals like Nicolae Iorga and Constantin Radulescu-Motru, under the patronage of [ROM.GetLeader], the Encyclopaedia is planned to encompass a great host of subjects related to Romania, and will be organised in three sections and six volumes. The first section containing the first two volumes, of which the first one, \"The State\" concerns itself with the State and encompasses the country's history, geography, political system and more, and the planned second one will focus on the administrative divisions. The second section will encompass Volumes 3 and 4, concerning themselves with the national economy and transports, circulation and commerce respectively, whereas the third section encompassing volumes 5 and 6 will focus itself on national culture and cultural institutions and personalities of note respectively.\n\nAn project long in the making, aided along by collaborators across the Carpathians and fortuitously finished after the Unification, it stands as a testament to the dedication of Professor Giusti to his craft and to his country. The next five volumes are slated for publication in the following years, further solidifying the legacy of him and his many collaborators to the scientific heritage of Romania."
 romania_events.166.d:9 "The Legionary Movement had risen from a small splinter group to become a very powerful force in Romanian politics... yet it seems they may be heading towards their predecessor's fate.\n\nThe once-small group grew rapidly in size and influence, especially after getting co-opted into power and after the unification with Transylvania, however with size it also gained a lot of problems. Codreanu's highly personalistic, circulary-focused and one-on-one contact-oriented leadership style has begun to falter, in spite of attempts to temper the growing zeal of his recruits. Tightening ranks, enforcing waits and probation periods between joining the Party and the Legion proper, a lot was attempted to try and temper the ballooning Iron Guard's growth and effervescence.\n\nYet, it was not enough. Many radicals across the various factions of the movement have begun to grow discontented with the \"parliamentarisation\" of the movement, and began to yearn for the earlier days of the Guard, when it was more militant and combative. The decline of revanchism also began to hit the Legionaries' odds by reducing the wellsprings they could tap into for support. Recent setbacks have weakened movement's unity even further and the factions that used to work together have begun to openly rally against each other. These factors, and more, have led to its own control over its own members beginning to fray at the edges, and now, it is beginning to snap.\n\nMany have begun to leave, others began to form splinter groups, and in general the once-mighty behemoth of the Iron Guard has begun to collapse under its own weight. While still a force to be reckoned with, at least in the near future, it will not reach the same prominence it once had, and it is theorised it will begin falling into the same downward spiral its predecessor, the LANC, once fell in."
 romania_events.171.d:9 "The day much-awaited by [GetSecondInCommand]'s cabinet has finally arrived, as Duce [ITA_GetNatPopLeader] of Italy has finally arrived in the capital. Greeted at the Banease airport by a dazzling array of orderly and disciplined soldiers alongside stern green shirt-clad Legionaries, Duce Ciano proceeded to meet his Romanian counterparts, being welcomed with the traditional bread and salt.\n\nThen the visit began in earnest. After a private discussion at the Prime Minister's residence between Ciano and Codreanu, the Duce and his delegation were given a tour of the Capital, taken to various sites showcasing the city's development; from the Belle Epoque area around Lipscani Street to the modern Magheru Boulevard, culminating in the arrival on Calea Victoriei and the new Royal Palace, where they were greeted by the King, and a joint declaration of friendship was signed. The next day, after other visits to various areas of the Capital ranging from the Inn of Manuc to the so-called \"Green House\", the Legionaries' Bucharest headquarters, Duce Ciano and the Italian delegation were taken to a Legionary worksite where he was shown the Greenshirts' work discipline. Later that day a state dinner was held at the Royal Palace.\n\nOn the third and final day, the delegation was taken to a concert showcasing traditional and modern Romanian and Italian music, before a second discussion with the Prime Minister, the Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministers and the King. After a pause to let the guests rest before the journey back to Italy, the Italian delegation was seen off at the Baneasa airport once more. Reportedly, Duce Ciano was pleasantly impressed by the reception given to him by his Romanian counterparts."
 romania_events.176.d:9 "Joyous news sweep the nation today as the Transalpina, also suggestively called \"The King's Road\", is finally finished!\n\nInaugurated in the presence of His Majesty the King and his Council of Ministers, the former having the honour of being the first to drive across it, the new road promises not only better ties between Transylvania and the Old Kingdom, but also shall bring forth an influx of tourists willing to see the spectacular sights of the Parang Mountains! Already plans are being drawn up for other possible mountain roads across the Carpathians."
 romania_events.177.d:9 "A long-established centre of ironworking and heavy industry, Resita has long prospered off the back of its heavy industry, industry that has as last fallen into our hands.\n\nWhile the facilities are held by the Austrian StEG concern, the obvious problem of the Austrian railway enterprise owning the works has arisen, and will be solved by gradually splitting off its assets within Romania; the railways proper going to the Romanian Railways state company and the Resita works going to a new industrial concern, to be named Uzinele si Domeniile Resita (Resita Domains and Works), or UDR for short.\n\nKnown iron importer and businessman Max Auschnitt has managed to position himself as administrator of the vast works while the transition is being carried out, and rumour has it he will seek to become the main manager of it.\n\nWhile the King may personally be fine with such a move considering Auschnitt's ties with the royal family, his business associate-turned-rival Nicolae Malaxa is protesting this takeover. He has put forward one of his men: engineer Virgil Ionescu, known donor to the \"Friends of the Legion\" association, regional commander and a seasoned Malaxa employee. Whom shall lead the new works forward, for the choice rests in His Majesty's hands..."
 romania_events.182.d:9 "Article 100: The Present Constitution, after it will be edicted by the King, shall be given to the Romanian nation for \"good knowledge and permission\".\n\nA Royal Decree will finalise the procedure which shall be followed to this purpose.\n\nAfter the completion of this operation and the bringing of its result to the notice of the King by the President of the Council of Ministers, the present Constitution shall be promulgated and shall enter into force."
 romania_events.185.d:9 "The Captain's brother-in-law and co-founder of the Legionary Movement, Ion Mota, has been at Codreanu's side for a long time; in the Legion's earliest days, he often was a bigger theorist of its beliefs than the Captain himself, who preferred to mantain a degree of flexibility in order to enhance the Legion's chances.\n\nNow, after the successful publication of For My Legionaries, Mota has released a book of his own, titled Cranii de lemn (Wooden Skulls), title taken from an article commemorating the death of a Legionary, killed in the movement's early days and having his death masked behind \"wooden language\". Containing a collection of Mota's most important articles on varying issues, from the origins of the Legion among nationalist studentry to the necessity of Greater Hungary's dismantlement, all the way to the mundane like miracles attributed to the Archangel Michael. Acting as a microcosm of Legionary beliefs, especially of its \"old guard\" agraro-mysticist side, the book has become very popular among Legionary circles, strengthening the reach of the so-called \"Old Guard\"."
 romania_events.186.d:9 "Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino, rising star of the Legionary Movement and de facto intellectual leader of its more radical caucuses, has further cemented his status as a leading Legionary intellectual via the release of his new book, \"Intre lumea legionara si lumea sindicalista\" (Between The Legionary World and the Syndicalist World). Building upon his speeches of past student congresses like Romanul de maine (The Romanian of Tomorrow), he also compares the varying ideological systems of Totalism, Kemalism, Savinkovism, the Volkish movement and Italian National Populism, as well as discussing Dostoyevsky, Berdyaev, Barrès and Jaurès. While he does acknowledge some similarities between the goals of Syndicalism and the Legionary Movement (namely, rejecting the nineteenth century's liberal tradition, abolishing social injustice, bank feudalism, privileges and capital speculations), he also sharply differentiates the movement from the Syndicalists in that they are considered worshippers of Marx, Proudhon and Pouget, builders of a second Tower of Babel who try to replace Christianity with atheism. Cantacuzino also considers that the Syndicalists are inhumane, annihilating the individual's personality and considering him as a means to an end, while Legionarism instead cares for their fellow peers and their physical and spiritual health, while also nurturing them and preparing the nation to \"stand at the borders of Romanianism, ready to defend and elevate the creations of the Romanian genius to the death\", an \"internal revolution\" against a \"mechanical society\".\n\nThe volume has proven to be a success among the Movement, giving further influence and intellectual backing to its radical caucus, with its emphasis on palingenetic rhetoric in the detriment of the mysticist element having further solidified Cantacuzino's standing as a Legionary theorist, and widened the intellectual horizon of the movement."
 romania_events.187.d:9 "Despite being more limited numerically, the Old Guard of the Legion has dramatically increased its intellectual influence among the movement, with newer recruits also beginning to adopt some of its agrarian and mysticist ideas. Articles written by long-time members like Ion Mota or somewhat younger members, but very influenced by them like Vasile Marin, have become more and more common among the Movement's rank and file, with the agrarian-mysticist zeal of the \"Founders\" beginning to influence even factory workers, the Legionary Worker Corps' typical demographic, who weren't as interested in this side of the movement beforehand.\n\nWhile the Captain can't help but admire to an extent that his brother-in-law and old comrade in arms is re-entrenching the guiding principles of the Legionary Movement among its adherents, he cannot help but notice that the intellectual and theoretical centre is beginning to drift towards Mota once more. To prevent sidelining, some support of the other factions would prove most useful."

 russia_events.30.d:9 "General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief], the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, has demanded the government increase the defence budget and initiate serious army reforms.\n\nA large number of generals signed a petition to the government that pointing out deficiencies in the current military equipment situation and highlighting the threat of the coming war as the reason why there should be no limits on military spending."
 russia_events.135.d:9 "It is known that many in the general corps have disdain for the President, but even the SZRS-aligned military men are not of one mind. With the recent military reforms, SZRS Instructor-Volunteers and Assault Battalions have been receiving disproportionate funding and personnel, demanded by army ideologues like Viktor Larionov, Vladimir Manstein, and Yury Shirinsky-Shikhmatov. Their programme is meant to permeate the entire Russian army with a new fervour and a philosophy of heroism, and do away with the aristocratic remnants of Russian military culture.\n\nLarionov ended in a harsh conflict with General Karl Gopper, the Inspector of the Army. A number of infantry school staff sent Gopper - who is in charge of ensuring that regulations are followed - a note, demanding an end to attempts to 'ideologise' higher military education as 'a frivolous waste of time and resources, directly conflicting with the 1929 Field Service Regulations'. Gopper, despite his personal yet waning loyalty to Savinkov, brought the matter up with the President himself, giving careful support to the demands. Gopper even threatened to side with [GetArmyChief] and made it clear how much he despises 'playing politics' in the army.\n\nNaturally, the very next day, Larionov came to meet the Vozhd, praising the successes of the units which have been informed by ideological teachings. Keenly aware of Gopper's opposition, he even suggested making Manstein instead the Inspector of the Army, to ensure the 'patriotic' control of the army, a snub no doubt directed at Gopper's nationality."
 RUS_defunded_VES:9 "Refused to Expand VES Resources"
 russia_events.244.d:9 "Unseen evidence regarding the assassination of Viktor Chernov has found its way into the hands of [GetArmyChief]. How he came by the information is unclear, and it's entirely possible the chief of the army commissioned the investigation himself, utilising only the military intelligence away from the prying eyes of the SZRS. After all, the fate of Lavr Kornilov left much of the army bitter, feeling that Savinkov had unjustly politicked to remove the venerated general.\n\nRegardless of how these documents came to be, they do seem to imply President Savinkov's more direct involvement in the assassination of Viktor Chernov, and that this was later used to incriminate Kornilov. This contradicts the official story, where the assassin was very likely acting on the direction of Lavr Kornilov. It is possible that this 'evidence' has been crafted to whitewash Kornilov's role in the assassination, and came under heavy criticism from party-affiliated intelligence services. If it came to light that Kornilov was framed and took the fall for Savinkov's own assassination, one can be sure the military's faith in Savinkov would plummet."
 russia_events.259.d:9 "The position of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief was created after the Civil War to ensure the independence of the military from the civilian government and to satisfy Lavr Kornilov's massive ego. At the same time, Kolchak was given an equal title, that of Supreme Admiral of the Navy, as a consolation prize. These positions also include control of the relevant ministry. However, this has meant that President Savinkov, in fact, has not been the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, but General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] has been.\n\nDespite the weakening of the position with legislation, thus far we have not dared to move so directly against the army as to remove their independent command structure. But with our current victories and amicable relations with [GetArmyChief], it would be very hard for the military to oppose appointing a new Supreme Commander-in-Chief, someone more loyal to Savinkov and less quarrelsome.\n\nOf course, General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] would keep their army command if they so wish and could retire in comfort after some years. It is more than time for someone else to carry their heavy burden for the Great Russian Republic."
 russia_events.267.d:9 "The Russian Air Force, the VVFR, has generally focused on small bombers and the support of land operations, largely because of Kornilov's insistence. Young air force officer and theorist Vasily Khripin has been a particularly vocal supporter of a change of direction: the air force should become an instrument of terror rather than a mere replacement for artillery.\n\nThe topic has also drawn the interest of the Vozhd, who has often expressed the importance of Russian aviation and showcased it in the SZRS' propaganda. It is said that his terrorist cell was already planning to utilise an aeroplane to assassinate the Tsar in 1907. With modern technology, air power has become 'the radical solution to the question of terror'. Instead of bombing individuals, modern technology enables bombing entire nations into terror and submission.\n\nHowever, the army's leadership is more sceptical - in particular, [GetArmyChief] argues that the current doctrine of battlefield support is a more effective use of Russia's limited bomber fleets. However, 'The Terror Lobby', centred around Khripin, are pushing for their own military school - and possibly, in the future, their own terror bombing force."
 russia_events.271.d:9 "Before the 1920s, Russian military intelligence was scattered between several departments and was severely understaffed. It was finally centralised and consolidated into the Fifth Department of the General Chief of Staff of the War Ministry in 1927, commonly called Pyatoe Otdelenie (5O). Since 1930 it has been headed by Pavel Shatilov, a known monarchist and a longtime friend and ally of Pyotr Wrangel. Under his leadership, the 5O saw further expansion and reorganisation, massively improving Russia's intelligence capabilities. Nevertheless, as we solidify control over the domestic and foreign intelligence apparatus within the Gosstrazha under Director Klepikov, Shatilov's political affiliations make him an unreliable element for the SZRS. While it is clear that Shatilov must go, Commander-in-Chief [GetArmyChief] and the military make it clear that they will not tolerate any structural changes to their departments. We have to make a choice.\n\nWe can acquiesce to the army's wishes and replace Shatilov with Pyotr Glazenap, one of the 5O's founders and its current deputy chief. A skilled intelligence officer, Glazenap possesses no loyalty to any military faction and has a history of being friendly towards the SZRS. However, it is also no secret that Glazenap is ambitious and his predisposition to our regime goes only as far as the stability of [RUS.GetNameDef].\n\nAnother option is Nikolay Sakharov, a SZRS veteran from the Civil War days, currently heading the Moscow Military District. While he is not quite as experienced as Glazenap, he compensates for it with political reliability and loyalty to Savinkov. Assigning him as the Chief of the Fifth Department would increase our influence within the General Staff without overtly angering [GetArmyChief].\n\nFinally, we have a third option. We can ignore the army's mandates, dissolve the 5O and transfer it from the General Staff, which reports to the Commander-in-Chief, to a new military intelligence department within the Gosstrazha, which reports directly to Klepikov and consequently - Savinkov himself. This will no doubt severely anger the military and [GetArmyChief], who will see this as a brazen infringement on the army's autonomy."
 russia_events.272.d:9 "The first attempts at special recon and sabatour units in Russia were the hunter (okhotnik) teams, small units of NCOs which existed 1886 to 1908. During the Great War, the Russian Army revived the concept in the shape of small units of irregular cavalry, formally known as Special Importance Detachments (Otryady osoboy vazhnosti), to conduct sabotage and intelligence operations behind enemy lines. While not particularly successful against the Germans, the experience gained was used to great effect by White cavalry and partisan detachments in raids and underground operations against the Bolshevik rear during the Civil War.\n\nGeneral-Major Nikolay Zuyev, lecturer at the General Staff Academy and veteran of the Punin Detachment, has approached [GetArmyChief] with a sweeping plan for recreating them under the name of Special Combat Detachments (Osobye boyevye otryady), as fully modern special forces with a standardised operational doctrine and somewhat expanded mission profile, including psychological warfare and the recruitment of sympathetic foreign nationals.\n\nThe proposal has received wide backing within the army, including General Staff luminaries such as General Kutepov, who was an okhotnik during the Russo-Japanese War, and Zuyev's colleague from the General Staff Academy, Nikolay Golovin. However, controversy has erupted over the extent of the programme; some only support a small, highly elite force directly under the General Staff, whereas others argue for its expansion to every front command.\n\nAs always, the ultimate decision lies with [GetArmyChief]."

Each man working to drill oil or build factories is a man who isn't serving in the army.

It seems this feeling is shared among much of the military. Ignoring [GetArmyChief]'s advice would surely anger them."

 russia_events.291.d:9 "Like after the Civil War, Russia's prisons are full of traitors and other miscreants. Unpatriotic protesters and strikers, communist saboteurs and provocateurs, German agents - the list is long and severe. However, many of these crimes can be made right through service to the Motherland. While the hated Katorga penal labour system was abolished in 1917 as a tool of Tsarist oppression, a special law was utilised after the Civil War for the Reds, and some 'Labour Colonies' were kept particularly for political prisoners.\n\nThe Restorative Labour Service Decree has once again been dug up by the government, which would temporarily add forced labour in Siberia as a punishment for certain types of criminals currently serving ordinary prison sentences. In exchange for work at Plan Voskhod's grand projects, the sentences of these criminals would be reduced. However, this may hurt the image of Plan Voskhod - it is meant to be a celebration of the Russian worker, not seen as a punishment. Some prison camps exist nonetheless, but if we decide to utilise prisoner labour for Voskhod, it would greatly increase our available manpower."
 russia_events.405.d:9 "At long last, [Root.GetNameDef] is free of German influence. For all of modern Russian history, our industry and natural resources have been subject to foreign interests, be they French, British, American or German - but with extensive restructuring of our economy, this is no longer the case. Factories and railroads built with foreign cash are now entirely in Russian hands, and they will remain so."
 russia_events.411.d:9 "You cannot remove one part of an economic system without affecting all the other parts. As an example, German textile dyeing plants of Moscow, operated by BASF, used Central Asian cotton and synthetic dyes imported from their factories in the Rhineland. Now, if severed from BASF's control, the supply of dyes collapses, and production of dyed clothing in Moscow becomes far less profitable. The problem becomes even more pronounced if the lacking resources are, say, German steel or rare earth minerals.\n\nFixing these issues takes time and requires some retooling of the industry, but ultimately it merely slows us down. The people of Moscow simply have to survive with less colourful clothing!"
 russia_events.426.d:9 "Japanese presence in North Sakhalin is based on two treaties - Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, and Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1921. The latter, negotiated by Vasily Boldyrev, then attache to Japan, agreed on Japanese withdrawal from North Sakhalin and other occupied territories and them withdrawing support from the Siberian rebel Atamans Semyonov and Kalmykov. In exchange, Japanese zaibatsus operating in Russia would be allowed to conduct business freely. What had for a moment seemed like potential military clash between Japan and resurgent Russia in 1921 was successfully de-escalated.\n\nKita Karafuto Sekiyu Kabushiki Gaisha (North Sakhalin Joint Stock Petroleum Company) continued management of oil fields in Okha and Katangli, which brought both development to northern part of the island. It was also clear that the company prioritised Japanese strategic interests over Russian ones, and there was even discussion on nationalisation already in 1928, in aftermath of Fengtian Conflict. But now Russia has abandoned any semblance of respecting their treaties, and has gone ahead with the nationalisation plans."

 russia_events.576.d:9 "After the destruction of the Tashkent Soviet Republic at the hands of Ataman Dutov's coalition of the Basmachi, the Orenburg Army and the Fergana Army, the revolution in Turkestan was finally extinguished a day after the New Year of 1921. The Turkestan and Alash Autonomies were organised as federal parts of Russia, while the protectorates of Khiva and Bukhara were maintained as client states.\n\nThe Turkestan (Kokand) Autonomy existed between 1921 and 1929 until its de facto independence under President Madamin Bek following the New Year's Coup. It had a similar legal framework as the Alash Autonomy, with its own parliament, government and elections. In practice, Madamin Bek remained as a dominant warlord of the autonomy after the civil war, comparable in position to that of Lavr Kornilov in Russia itself. But now Madamin Bek's revolt lies in ruins, and the territory of the former 'Republic of Turkestan' is occupied by the Russian Army. The question remains: should a reformed autonomy be created?"
 russia_events.912.b:9 "[GetArmyChief] puts his subordinates in line."
 russia_events.913.d:9 "The shoddy coup attempt by Colonel Fortunatov some time ago was the last straw. While there is still no clarity if [GetArmyChief] has any knowledge in advance or even part in the planning, he is obviously denying everything. Instead, he used this as a pretext for major personnel changes in the military, seeking to remove 'unprofessional' officers.\n\nOfficially, this is to root out loose cannons like Boldyrev had been, but in practice he is also removing prominent Svobodniks and other 'politicised' officers. The military commissars in particular have been complaining, and in some cases the Vozhd has interfered. The cohabitation between the Army and the Party seems to be reaching a boiling point, and one has to give up eventually."
 russia_events.914.d:9 "It was midnight, and the plan sprang into action. Units of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division had been transferred near Moscow for manoeuvres weeks earlier. Tight security had been maintained to avoid Klepikov's all-seeing spy network - all operated on personally given orders, between men who had fought and bled together decades prior.\n\nIn the dead of the night, the 13th Infantry Regiment would take over the Ministry of Interior and decapitate Savinkov's intelligence services. The 200th Infantry Regiment would hit the main bridges and radio stations, while the 6th Infantry Regiment would escort [GetArmyChief] to the Kremlin and arrest the president. Another division would be ordered to block the roads leading to Moscow.\n\nNo matter who won, there would be firing squads tonight.\n\nThe coup began catastrophically. Gosstrazha units guarding the ministry refused to lay down their weapons, and a shootout began. Much better armed and trained regulars rapidly won out, but the delay let Savinkov be warned, and he had left the Kremlin by the time [GetArmyChief] got there. Fortunately for the putschists, the president's convoy was intercepted on his way to Bykovo airport. Savinkov's armour-plated Buick became the centre of a shootout, and his guard - including his trusted spymaster Klepikov - were killed in the crossfire. Wounded, Savinkov himself was captured and shortly after executed after a drumhead court-martial held by [GetArmyChief]. Among the charges were mass murder, sabotage, and corruption.\n\nThe body was burned soon after, and mass arrests of the Savinkovites began."
 russia_events.914.d2:9 "Savinkov had grown more and more paranoid during the war, but he was not yet invincible. An assassination was far too risky; Savinkov had to be removed, but without his supporters rallying for him. Kornilov's attempt in 1936 had been a simple-minded, direct gamble - and Savinkov had always had Miss Fortune as a lover when it came to gambling. General-Fieldmarshal Wrangel elected to go about it in a more safe way.\n\nWith months of preparation, it was ensured that there was a meeting of the War Cabinet where multiple of Savinkov's most loyal soldiers were not present after their promotions, and replaced with less experienced Gosstrazha officers. Immediately, Savinkov demanded increased security, but the schemers acted before his command could be fulfilled. The three highest ranking officers present in the meeting - Pyotr Wrangel, [GetNavyChief], and Sergey Markov - informed Savinkov and his Chairman-Minister that they must step down due to their catastrophic conduct of the war. The guards present refused the Vozhd's order to shoot Wrangel, either out of fear, confusion, or respect.\n\nWell aware that Savinkov - even alive but arrested - would still carry tremendous authority, a quick decision was made to court-martial him. Both Pyotr Wrangel and [GetNavyChief] would have preferred for the man to stand for a fair trial, but ultimately admitted that in these conditions, it was not possible. Savinkov also refused to sign a document of resignation, declaring that the Russian people will tear the plotters apart for what they have done. These were among his last words, as he was shot by a firing squad in the backyard of the headquarters.\n\nWith the beast decapitated, the Russian government more or less fell apart. The initial, critical hours saw forces loyal to Wrangel close down the capital and arrest most high-ranking Svobodniks and Gosstrazha officers, and across the country resistance was only sporadic - not many were willing to stand against the authority of the White generals to defend the dead dictator."
 russia_events.918.d:9 "The Vozhd's underground bunker is a sour place. Every day it becomes clearer that all is lost. Savinkov himself has become erratic - some days he binges on morphine and methamphetamine, others he dwells in dark poetry, immersed in apocalyptic visions. Other days he talks of his fear that the military will simply shoot him, and how he should have killed all those Tsarist lackeys when he had the chance. Those closest to him, the Dikgofs and Flegont Klepikov, have tried to talk him into leaving Russia, with no avail.\n\nHis final words, recorded by his mistress Lyubov Dikgof, were 'Fate gave me indomitable energy and the heart of a revolutionary. So I went on until I was convinced of my mistake'.\n\nHe was found in his bunker office, loaded but not shot revolver by his side, having died of heart failure following a morphine overdose. He left no will.\n\nThe military wasted no time. [GetArmyChief] issued a communiqué, informing the nation of the army appointing him to serve as the Supreme Leader. The coup was implemented quickly, suggesting that the military had been preparing to do it anyway. The army assured their first priority is to save Russia from impending military catastrophe, and punish everyone who was complicit in almost destroying Russia for their own personal gain."
 russia_events.927.d:9 "Mere days had passed since the death of Savinkov. Many of the SZRS top names had been arrested, shot, or fled the country. However, while the military command had been largely apathetic to Savinkov's last days, the possibility of a socialist takeover had widely alarmed the military. The Socialist-Revolutionaries had made power grabs in cities, even appointing a socialist as their own War Minister.\n\nA crisis meeting was held in Kaluga under the guard of the oldest veteran formations of the army. A small inner circle of officers discussed and recognised the perilous situation. Even if the Socialist-Revolutionaries stayed true to their promise and restored free elections, a civil war could be sparked through a multitude of ways - it only needed one commander to act without thinking. The only way to stop a second civil war would be removing the socialists from power with a swift and decisive move, but allowing them representation in a more-or-less socialist provisional government overseen by the military. Essentially, the coup had to gain democratic credentials.\n\nThe plan was put into action as soon as possible. Secret messages were relayed, and private meetings were held outside the ears of officers with SR loyalties. And then [GetArmyChief] struck: Guard units quickly overwhelmed the defenders in various parts of Moscow, took over the radio stations, and put the government under watch. A communiqué was read aloud to the people: this was not a coup, but merely the military stepping up to do their duty, which is to ensure order. A careful tone was kept in references to the socialists - that they were merely 'democrats' and had 'collaborated with the army'. In practice, the government had been threatened with arrest if they did not comply.\n\nAnd the moment Socialist-Revolutionaries lost the upper hand, their military advantage was gone. Moscow was under the control of [GetArmyChief]. The socialists were still part of the provisional government, but they were forced to allow a large number of non-socialists into this government."

The situation is clear: the Assembly has failed to come up with their own version, so the military-proposed version will be accepted.\n\nIt is relatively uncontroversial, largely focusing on a strong executive branch with an electoral system favouring the status quo parties, and allowing for the harsh suppression of both communist and Svobodnik parties. It is a tolerable compromise, even if the Assembly made it clear that they are not happy with such military meddling."

 russia_elections_events.10.d:9 "The Kremlin and its temporary occupant, General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief], have made a much-expected announcement: elections, the first ones in what seems like an eternity, will be held in three months. Regardless of the election outcome, the state of emergency upheld by the military will be ended afterwards, and power will be fully transferred into the hands of the civilian government - though it is clear that [GetArmyChief] will maintain a large amount of influence behind the scenes.\n\nRussia's major parties are feverishly preparing, trying to fill their ranks, collect funding, and rebuild both their party machinery and their ideas. Everyone understands how important the [GetYear] election is going to be: unlike in a normal electoral cycle, where not every position is elected simultaneously, now all seats in both chambers of the Duma are up for grabs, and similarly all Gubernial Dumas. [russia_elections_events.10.president]\nPerhaps this is another beginning for a new, better Russia."
 russia_elections_events.19.d:9 "'Who elected [GetArmyChief]?', ask the signs carried by the protestors who have gathered in the Red Square of Moscow. One of the most visible leaders of the protests has been Valentin Fyodorovich Bulgakov, a Christian anarchist and Tolstoyan pacifist. The march against the military has drawn all manners of people around the anarchists, including more socialist anarchists from the Society of Kropotkin, and even some more average socialists.\n\nThe main demands of the protestors are to free the political prisoners that the army arrested during the state of emergency, ending the state of emergency, and an end to army interference in politics. On a broader scale, it is a protest against the constantly escalating world situation and jingoistic rhetoric that many in the Russian officer corps have adopted. Some are flying red flags and demanding international peace between all nations, but at least they sang hymns instead of the Internationale."
 russia_elections_events.29.d:9 "The grassroots campaign of the All-Russian Patriotic Party has been intense and stronger than ever before, but it is not thanks to the old guard of the party. Instead, much of the party rank and file are more loyal to Ivan Solonevich, who gained a record vote in the traditionally left-liberal Petrograd. His campaign was built around his own 'People's Monarchist Movement', and many remembered well his shirtless appearances at sports events, and keen speeches at Petrograd University with full auditoriums. The party's decision to accept former Svobodniks not tried for any crimes has only bolstered this, and they have been swayed by Solonevich's populist and authoritarian rhetoric.\n\nThis has led Golitsyn and other 'aristocrats' of the party to have their authority challenged by the Solonevichs, whose allies, like Sergey Voytsekhovsky and Boris Suvorin, have gained control of much of VPP's party newspapers. These 'Solonevichites' have been pushing for the VPP to adopt a more populistic, 'modern' programme based on Solonevich's ideas, and even began pressuring Golitsyn to step down and make Solonevich the party's presidential candidate instead, or threaten to secede from the party.\n\nIn an emergency meeting by the party brass, it was ultimately decided to strike a deal - as Solonevich's popularity gives the party a genuine shot at the presidency. Golitsyn felt comfortable that as long as the government was composed of more reliable statesmen, the president will be kept in check."
 russia_elections_events.31.d:9 "The [GetYear] elections have produced the most unlikely result: Daniil Sulimov, a committed socialist, is the new President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. Already, the situation is tense. The army is extremely suspicious of Sulimov's intentions, and the right, outraged by the left's victory, has already made calls for [GetArmyChief] to step in once again to remove the 'Bolshevik occupying the Kremlin'.\n\nFor Sulimov, he has no doubts about where his presidency will lead. It will either be the triumph of the revolutionaries and the destruction of the bourgeois republic, or prison for him and his comrades."

The army has the power to define governments if it so seeks - perhaps its most powerful shows of power have been torpedoing Chernov's almost-sure presidency in 1926, and pressuring the Avksentyev Administration into the catastrophic Fengtian War.\n\nNow, [GetArmyChief]'s representatives are demanding President [ROOT.GetLeader] to confirm what kind of role the military's trusted politicians will have in the future Duma and State Council committees. It seems that the military brass is growing less and less happy with our government, and are now demanding more of 'their men' at the important tables. It is no secret that almost every party has these 'patriots' who serve as political spokespersons for the army."

General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] arrested the government and declared martial law in the city until proper transfer of power is organised. In a simple radio address by the military to the people, it was assured that a responsible government would soon take the reins, and the military would only see its role as guarantor of the nation.

The elections felt to many like the Duma elections after the Stolypin coup of 1908: pointless.\n\nIn the end, the conservatives and the right wing Kadets held a majority of the seats - largely being the favourites of the military. As the former president was forced to resign after the coup, the new parliament will start by electing the eighth President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic."
 russia_democratic_events.105.d:9 "After the ban of the SZRS and a number of other 'Svobodnik' organisations, the Russian far-right was essentially beheaded. But like a Hydra, a new head will always grow, and now it has taken the form of the Young Guard. The Guard claims to be a 'non-partisan political movement' that 'mobilises patriots to defend Great Russia'. Initially, it was led by Savinkov's former acquaintance Yury Shirinsky-Shikhmatov, but he is currently imprisoned for his actions in 1936, and the leadership has passed to former Colonel Sergey Ivanov.\n\nThe movement is clearly modelled after the Iron Guard in Romania, and espouses ultra-reactionary beliefs - though clearly avoiding any statements that would connect them to Savinkov too closely. As the Guardsmen are organising new marches, many are most reminded of the Black Hundreds and their successor organisations. The Guard has tried to avoid violence and other clear illegalities, presumably out of fear that the movement will be banned immediately."
 russia_democratic_events.115.d:9 "The great wave of strikes choking Russia has only expanded, despite our attempts to curb it. Left-wing sympathies are growing ever more common across Russia, often connected to grave disappointment in our government's actions.

[GetSecondInCommand]'s government is bombarded from the right and left, and our coalition is at the breaking point - with parts of it demanding immediate, decisive action against the civil unrest, and others demanding a new, left-wing government that could properly calm down the situation.\n\nSome advisors fear that General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] will not tolerate any concessions to the revolutionaries, and expect that the military might react in a hostile way should [ROOT.GetLeader] appoint a left-wing government."
 russia_democratic_events.121.d.socrus:9 "A clandestine meeting took place in Moscow today in the secure underground part of the War Ministry. The military delegation was to meet the Russian political and military leadership personally, as the matter was too secretive to risk the possibility of interception. It was under the leadership of General Georges Catroux, with Charles Delestraint as his deputy and Edmund Ironside leading the representation of the British military. They were received by [RUS.GetLeader] and the Russian chief of the army, [RUS.GetArmyChief], with his closest associates.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was bold: to draft a coordinated plan that would destroy the German Empire between the hammer of France and the anvil of Russia. While, in practice, two separate fronts would not be able to cooperate much, decisions were made on encrypted channels for intel cooperation and plans for maintaining the Arctic maritime connection during the war.\n\nSome points of contention arose when strategic priorities were discussed. For the western delegation, the highest eastern priority was placed on Baku and other German oil reserves, while the Russians argued that the Baltics and Ukraine were more important directions. The actual strategy was left somewhat open, but all militaries agreed on permanent military attachés in each high command to smoothen future cooperation."
 russia_democratic_events.121.d.demrus:9 "Surprisingly, a clandestine military meeting took place in Petrograd today, which would have been more in place in 1915 than in [GetYear]. A joint Franco-British military delegation met with General-Fieldmarshal [RUS.GetArmyChief] today in surprisingly positive terms. The delegation was under the leadership of General Georges Catroux, with Charles Delestraint as his deputy and Edmund Ironside leading the representation of the British military.\n\nOne could almost forget about the ideological disagreements of their respective governments as they laid out a strategic plan for the destruction of Germany in a calm, professional manner. Both sides withheld information, no doubt thinking about the possible future conflict if they manage to destroy Germany, but were open enough to agree on sharing relevant military intel and some other matters that would make cooperation easier.\n\nAfter all, both of them shared a simple, greater goal: the destruction of the German Empire and avenging the peace of 1919. And for these military men, it was a greater cause than any ideology."
 russia_democratic_events.123.d:9 "General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] has requested an emergency meeting of the cabinet to discuss actions that the government will be taking following the Shatilov Report's recommendations. Chairman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] was undeniably bitter about such a request, as it showcases how the Minister of War is, in practice, more powerful than the head of government, if push comes to shove.\n\nIt was no ordinary cabinet meeting, either. The Minister of War, [GetArmyChief], was essentially requesting the [RUS_leader]'s permission to start preparations for Operation Yekaterina, the pre-emptive invasion of German-controlled Eastern Europe. While the decision on war and peace rests on the State Duma and the [RUS_leader], the military only needs the permission of [GetSecondInCommand] to start implementing the necessary precautions in case of war.\n\nThe implicit threat was clear: the army merely expects political backing for already-decided operations, and if that is not given, the government may lose the trust of the whole army."

Titov has often spoken against the 'revolutionary tyranny' of the West, instead always standing up for moderation. The Radical-Democratic Party has grown greatly and successfully convinced many workers of the cities from more radical political beliefs into its ranks. After all, most of these poor workers support socialism because of their own living conditions - a matter that has greatly improved with the RDP's social programmes. Similarly, the Vsodes has managed to entrench itself as the leader of the Russian labour unions, maintaining close connections with the government. All this has given the RDP a clear edge over other parties.

These depths of Russia are our base, for the rural folk know that the Socialist-Revolutionaries will always stand for them, against the capitalists and the bureaucrats of Moscow and other centres. The PSR has become the undisputed leading party of Russian political and societal life. We have helped great numbers of poor peasant families to acquire education, gifted men and women who are joining politics and civil service more and more often, further solidifying the role of Socialist-Revolutionaries as the party of all Russia."

It has been proven time and again that the Russian people are simply too uneducated - well-meaning, surely, and often in good faith - to direct the state properly, and will always need those more educated to handle their duty of steering Great Russia, like a captain steers the ship and is responsible for the well-being of every man on board."

This is the role that has fallen on the shoulders of Russia time and again.\n\nDid we not defend the Christendom of Europe from the Asiatic hordes, as its stalwart eastern guard? Did we not continue the millennia-old tradition of the Roman Empire after the fall of Constantinople? Did we not defend all that was good and proper against the Robespierrean tyranny?\n\nSome claim that Russia is in some way inherently authoritarian, but we disagree. Instead, Russia's path is that of a holy warrior, God's Knight following a simple life. He has no time for flights of fancy, for his duty and faith are too great.

This is the moment that has often been referenced in Imperial propaganda as proof that Kirill shares the legacy of the February Revolution, just as the SRs or the Kadets do.\n\nTo commemorate the event, the Imperial court has asked Admiral [GetNavyChief] to transfer an elite unit of his Marine Infantry to be used to restore Tsar Kirill's Marine Guard - a tradition stemming from his naval service at the time. The Tsar wishes for a full brigade-sized unit under his control, to serve both as a ceremonial and an actual guard force.\n\nThis has raised some eyebrows, as transferring the protection of the Imperial family from state security forces to those under Tsar-appointed officers would give the Tsar a private army, albeit a small one. However, it is still just a brigade - it is not like it can pose a threat. It also reminds many of Savinkov's use of special uniformed units as a tool of propaganda - though it may be good to give people new military symbols in place of those Savinkov utilised."

Ironically, Boldyrev's warning from 1929 rang true, and the history of Russia may have been different if his words had been heeded by Kornilov.\n\nBut both Savinkov and Kornilov are gone, and it is up to lesser figures to save the nation. The initial meeting was careful and probing, but it was agreed that ending the war was in both sides' advantage. [GetArmyChief] was very concerned about German influence over Boldyrev's so-called 'Free Russia', and was extremely bitter over the whole situation - but rational enough to recognise that there will not be a military miracle.\n\nBoldyrev's negotiators have proposed a deal. The [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government surrenders to the Free Russian Government, and [GetArmyChief] keeps command of the armed forces. Elections are to be arranged immediately, with those aligned with the earlier regime barred from running. Vasily Boldyrev and his allies are cleared of any treason charges, and their military ranks are reinstated."

 russia_flavour_events.42.d.dem:9 "Decades of defeat, leaving the fratricidal bloodletting of the Civil War aside, have had an indisputably corrosive effect on the morale of the Russian military. Despite high military budgets and veneration of the army, many remember atrocities committed by the Whites and still see the military as a tool of the oppressors. Especially after the military humiliation of 1928 and the ensuing Boldyrev Putsch, many rallied behind the SZRS with slogans of restoring the army to its former glory. It is no secret that in the 1934 elections SZRS made huge gains in every garrison town.\n\nAnd now Savinkov is five feet under, but the army finds itself greater and stronger than ever, in newfound strength. General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] styles himself as the Saviour of Russia and is easily second only to the [RUS_leader].

Furthermore, if Russia is to live up to its new reputation as a democratic beacon of the world, then it needs to show it with actions and not words.\n\nA more fringe view is that giving them too much freedom comes with a cost, and that allowing our allied states to contest Moscow can only lead to the dissolution of the Accord at some point. Harsher measures should not be shied away from - as long as they ensure Russia's status as a great power."

 russia_flavour_events.144.d:9 "Now one of the greatest Russian heroes of the 1900s, Vladimir Nikolayevich has been moulded into many things in the minds of the Russian public.

He is living proof that even the most run-of-the-mill man can become a star of the century.\n\nThrough his victories, he has cemented several things for Russia: a democratic future, PSR dominance in elections for at least the next few decades, and more. All of this was accomplished through a rough battle against the Russian right, proving correct his own idealistic vision. Even some fellow party members, like Sorokin, who sometimes came to disagree with Vladimir Nikolayevich on his tactics, credits the President with the destruction of the organisational power of the right.\n\nBut for any party that has set itself up for the future, there remains an uneasy question to be asked. Will the victories that brought the Socialist-Revolutionaries to the front repeat? Vladimir Nikolayevich's victories may be spoken of and praised, yes, but will they be emulated with the same fighting spirit? Will the party be dethroned after we run out of steam, or even worse, become just another party of power, a party that does not believe in the Russian people but only in itself?"

The attack was led by the famed Abrek couple, Laysat Baysarova and Akhmetkhan Baysarov. Obviously, the writing of the achievements of these mountain bandits is forbidden, but the word has been spreading nonetheless. The couple - one Ingush, one Chechen - have only risen in fame and became shining stars of the Mountain people's independence movement.\n\nAbreks are usually held as mere bandits by Russian authorities, but they have been leading the Ingush-Chechen struggle against the Russians for a century now. An Abrek is a lost man - one who has given up civilian life, normal human connections, and lives a pious life in the wild mountains of North Caucasus and has dedicated his life in the fight with the Russians. Abreks have been among the leading figures of all North Caucasus unrest, and the mountains have made it difficult to ever catch them. And consequently, they have become heroes to the locals.\n\nAlready hundreds of stories circulate about the deadly sniper Laysat and her fight against the Svobodniks together with her husband. It is clear that this path can only end tragically for them, but as long as it continues, our men will fear going into the mountains."

Despite the failures of the unit, it continues to inspire some more radical politicians within our party.\n\n[GetArmyChief] reported that under pressure from politicians he has organised the Separate Women's Volunteer Infantry Brigade, but in the meantime he established strict physical standards and sent them to the rear for military training, which, in his words, 'God knows, they will need'. [GetArmyChief] at the last meeting with the [RUS_HeadOfExecutive] categorically refused to send women to the frontline, instead preferring to keep them in a support role.\n\nFor now, we have several options for how to resolve the issue: allow the Separate Women's Volunteer Infantry Brigade to complete their training and send it to the frontline (regardless of the warnings of the military experts that this is a terrible idea); reassign women to the support personnel, which will relieve men from these positions; or simply outright admit that women have no place near the frontlines, and should contribute to the war effort in the factories instead."
 russia_flavour_events.168.d:9 "The morning in the Kremlin began chaotically. At 6 o'clock, a representative of the Stavka very rudely demanded that the president should organise a meeting with General-Fieldmarshal [GetArmyChief] as quickly as possible. Arriving at the Stavka a few hours later, Savinkov - expecting to hear news of some kind of military catastrophe - learned that it was not a matter of war, but of the actions of one of the Svobodnik Volunteer Battalions. A few weeks ago, after one of the battles, the army managed to surround a fairly large number of enemy forces. Because of the situation on the frontline, the military did not have time to escort prisoners to the rear and transferred this task to the 135th Volunteer Battalion under the command of the SZRS Commissar Vladimir Brand.\n\nBrand contacted the local Gosstrazha commander Aleksandr Andreyev to ask for directions and was told that the nearby prisoner camps were already full, and there were issues at organising train transport given the supply situation. The Gosstrazha commander told Brand to 'deal with the problem'. Brand contacted local SZRS leadership and asked for a confirmation for the order, and was told that, as the Gosstrazha is responsible for the management of the prison system, the party fully agrees with their decisions.\n\nHearing that, Brand and his men armed themselves with captured German weapons and went to the nearby forest with almost 5,000 prisoners, where they were gunned down into a small ravine. After the site of the massacre was discovered by military scouts, Brand was faced with the army commander and admitted that he received orders from his superiors and carried them out in the way that seemed most appropriate for the situation. As a result, 4,842 prisoners of war (mostly soldiers from Eastern Europe) were shot from German weapons in the frontline zone. [GetArmyChief] is furious and insists on punishing those responsible for such an atrocity, for the sake of military honour."
 russia_flavour_events.179.d:9 "All is not well in the recently liberated city of Sevastopol, known for its peculiar character and even more peculiar politics. Long before 1917, it was considered a bastion of Jewish intellectualism and political thought. Sevastopol, alongside Kiev, was the headquarters of many Jewish political movements, with the Ukrainian Jewish Democratic Party being one of the most prominent recent examples.\n\nHowever, under the re-established Russian authority, there are relentless efforts to extinguish that flame. With the initial wave of violence by Russian soldiers having subsided, what remains of the Jews of Ukraine now faces prolonged oppression—oppression by legislation, police, and litigators. The [RUS.GetRulingParty] government swiftly launched a vast campaign to 'root out lingering Bolshevism and Germanism in the liberated lands'. This campaign quickly targeted Jews, especially in Sevastopol, Kiev, and Minsk, but also in many other cities.\n\nThis 'legal anti-semitism' has resulted in the imprisonment and deportation of Jewish civil and cultural leaders and the forced disbandment of every Jewish political party still active. The older generation express frustration, seeing this new regime as no different from the Tsarist regime of old. Others believe that the targeting of Jews is a deliberate move to give ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarussians a common enemy, aiding in the 'reintegration' efforts of [RUS.GetNameDef]. Most simply shrug or flee."
 russia_flavour_events.180.d:9 "February 1917—etched in history as the downfall of the 'eternal' Tsarist regime. Like a storm at sea, the revolution's ripples quickly reached the Jewish sphere, giving rise to myriad political forces eager to address the woes of Jews now under new rulers in the so-called 'Oststaaten'. Since then, Jewish engagement in civil life has dramatically increased, with political parties catering to the Jewish minority emerging as a significant force in eastern Europe.\n\nThose accustomed to the new status quo were unprepared for 'another February' to sweep across eastern Europe. Yet another dramatic shift in two and a half decades seemed inconceivable, but with the Russian victory over Germany, it is now a reality.\n\nDespite numerous reports of violence by the Russian Army against Jews during the conflict, the government swiftly reaffirmed its commitments to minority rights and religious freedom, and eventually, the storm passed. The return of peace brings another question: where to from here?\n\nAmong the first to act was the liberal Ukrainian Jewish Democratic Party, now known simply as the Jewish Democratic Party, which united with the Jewish Democratic Union from Minsk to reaffirm their commitment to [RUS.GetNameDef]. Despite their support primarily coming from Jews in the liberated territories, the Jews in Petrograd and Moscow seem largely disinterested. In practice, these Jewish parties shape up to be tertiary players in Russian politics, often allied with the [RUS.GetRulingParty]."

However, the military, under the leadership of [RUS.GetArmyChief] took over soon after to restore a more moderate government.

 serbia_events.12.d:9 "The Serbian Chetniks recount history starting with the liberation struggle against the Ottoman Empire, where they served as auxiliary partisan forces in the Balkans to support the regular Serbian Army. After the Weltkrieg, the Treaty of Wartholz ordered all armed Chetnik associations to be dissolved, but the veterans of the partisan struggle remained and initially stood in favour of King Aleksandar II and his regime. By 1925, however, only the hardcore Royalists among their ranks chose to resist the fall of the monarchy, leaving the first few months of the Republic somewhat unstable — whereas many stood down and accepted the change in regime if it means that the dream of Greater Serbia can continue. Chetnik associations have since been reestablished and began to rearm themselves, but their loyalty to republicanism is still questioned.\n\nThe recent rise of the Socialist Workers' Party has left the \"loyalist\" Chetniks far more than worried, however. While they can begrudgingly tolerate a republic, a possible socialist regime is completely intolerable - and so, Chetnik voivodes such as Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin have reached out to the government, demanding something to be done - or else they will take matters to their own hands. The threat of monarchist sympathies among the Chetniks has remained ever since the Revolution, so it cannot simply be ignored - and chances are that no matter what we will do, large sections of the military will no longer trust us..."

 serbia_events.130.d:9 "A mere few days after the election concluded, the streets of Belgrade have begun to buzz with activity. The rumours of royalist sympathisers organising a putsch against the socialist-influenced government were true. The White Hand, led by the former commander of the Royal Guard Petar Živković, has been playing the strings from the shadows - this military clique, loyal to the House of Karađorđević, played a pivotal role in Aleksandar's Royal Dictatorship and never quite dissolved, only moving to the underground to foster their resistance.\n\nBelgrade awoke to the sound of gunfire as a royalist brigade marched in, locking down the city and surrounding the Skupština, taking [SER.GetLeader] and the members of the legislature hostage. Petar Živković gave his two demands; ending the exile of the House of Karađorđević and the appointment of him as Prime Minister. Yet, the coup attempt only lasted a few hours. Royalist putschists were unable to take control of the communications or cut the phone lines, so the supreme command of the Serbian Army were soon informed of the mutiny.\n\nGenerals loyal to the Konspiracija secret society, firmly in control of almost the entire army, immediately moved republican military units to Belgrade. The putschists, surrounded themselves, outgunned and unable to break the government, soon surrendered. Democracy in Serbia was safe, and paradoxically the radical nationalists in the Konspiracija saved the socialist government from being overthrown."
 serbia_events.130.a:9 "But... how will we overthrow THEM?"
 serbia_events.18.d:9 "The first President of the Serbian Republic and one of the most venerated statesmen from the Republican Party, Jakov \"Jaša\" Prodanović, has been assassinated today. The sudden, despicable act took place in the politician's home in Belgrade, which several armed agents suddenly forced themselves into and executed their victim without remorse - it was reported by the politician's son Borislav, who happened to come by to visit a few hours later.\n\nElected in 1926, Prodanović consolidated the gains of the Republican Revolution and pursued vast reform in order to establish what he perceived as a compassionate, democratic nation. His career, both in political and literary affairs, preceded him for decades before the Revolution too, and he had served in ministerial positions as early as before the Weltkrieg. However, staunchly opposed to militarism and authoritarianism, he came into conflict with the Konspiracija secret society and so ultimately chose to not seek reelection - because of this, and his later support for anti-Konspiracija endeavours, rumours are abound that it was they who signed off his life.\n\nThe officers and generals in their lodges and circles understandably feel threatened - as omnipotent as their control over Serbia may feel sometimes, their network has always been fragile, and now that we have chosen to resist their influence openly, they have given us a warning. A line they have drawn in the sand, with Prodanović's blood:\n\nIf you take any step further, others will suffer the same.\n\nOr perhaps that's only what they want us to think..? The investigation into the assassination begins - and before the military kills it, we may have a once in a lifetime opportunity to cut off the sword of Damocles above us."
 serbia_events.20.d1:9 "Whether through a calculated move or as an act of unprecedented boldness, the democratically elected government of Serbia chose to make a stand against their benefactors, openly accusing the Serbian Army and its secret cliques of having murdered the former President. The motivations behind this turn, no matter what they were, matter little today, as their results have been disastrous. Sensing that the civilian government is making the accusation from fragile grounds, the Konspiracija has retaliated, mobilising everything at their disposal.\n\nThe coalition in the Skupština has fractured as more and more deputies voice their concern with the President's \"treasonous\" policy. One by another, publications and newspaper articles show up blasting the government of having mishandled the investigation into Prodanović's death and searching for imaginary enemies to recuperate. Even the son of the killed President has shown his face, standing in favour of the military and its goals. The investigation has receded, and soon, the courts hastily declared that the former President was shot by a lone Royalist fanatic.\n\nNo longer can the President and his ministers walk safely in night, knowing that they might be next on the secret society's kill list. Their last chance to blunt the fangs of \"the second Black Hand\" have failed, and now, they can only cope in silence, hoping that they can survive and wait the military's radicalism out."

Our authorities and any of their attempts to maintain order there have been powerless, and Mihajlov's organisation has established a \"state within a state\" there - with their own army, law enforcement, and even taxation.

In the end, a temporary retreat from the region has been called, to consolidate the army's positions in the north and cut unnecessary losses.\n\nSkopje, the capital of Macedonia, is now a picturesque sight.

Representatives from all liberated regions of Macedonia have gathered in the capital and proudly declared Ivan Mihajlov to be the first president of the Independent State of Macedonia.\n\nAs its first act, the constituent assembly of Macedonia declared the \"restoration of immortal, historical ties between the peoples of Vardar Macedonia and Bulgaria\" and sent an official diplomatic note to the government in Sofia, requesting the return of Bulgarian troops to their rightful soil. Any and all control we still have over Macedonia is slipping by the second, and unless we take a stand against the Bulgarians, we may lose it for good..."
 serbia_events.310.d:9 "As war unfolds around Serbia, the Macedonian region grows even more unruly than before. Soldiers once used to police the countryside are forced to be diverted elsewhere, giving the IMRO room to breathe, and allowing them to enact the next stage of their plan to liberate Macedonia. In the mountains surrounding the Vardar Valley, voivodes of the IMRO have gathered to proclaim the independence of the \"Independent State of Macedonia\", and follow it with a call for all Macedonians to take arms and evict the hated Serbian invader from their lands once and for all. From these mountains, their komitas descend, and open warfare breaks out across the region once more."
 serbia_events.35.d:9 "Recently, [From.GetNameDef] has set up the \"Balkan Research Initiative\", an international pooling of scientific and investigative minds to help strengthen the region. Though not declared, it's clear that the Initiative's primary goal is to bolster our military capacity in preparation for war against those who threaten us.\n\n[From.GetAdjective] diplomats have afforded us a formal invitation to the group, which would require us to divulge military and industrial secrets in exchange for Serbian plans and information. It could be a lucrative endeavour, however it could also result in [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s simply strengthening themselves off of our hard work. How should we respond to the invitation?"

 serbia_events.43.d:9 "The People's Radical Party and the Agrarians have maintained close ties between each other ever since the latter's formation from Main Association of Serbian Agricultural Cooperatives in 1919. While the Agrarians have generally been a movement representing very specific rural concerns, their alliance with the Radicals granted them the ability to address them, while the Radicals could not say no to a reliable partner in the Skupština and outside of it — a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nWith the initiative of President Milan Stojadinović, the two parties have made a next step in their cooperation by joining into a single party — the Serbian Radical Union. The President will maintain his role as party leader in the new association, but party elections will be held in all chapters to determine the vice-chairmen and secretaries, with one of the vice positions already reserved to Milan Gavrilović, the leader of the former Agrarian Party.\n\nNicknamed \"Sarez\" after the abbreviation of its name, the Radical Union now wields a wide majority in the Skupština, and already some express their worries about such a powerful bloc united behind the President..."
 serbia_events.49.d:9 "Before the Skupština, representing the Republican delegation, Milan Grol delivered a speech explaining that their party was no longer able to cooperate with President Milan Stojadinović and the Radical Union — all while delivering cold comments on the, as the former Prime Minister put it, \"undemocratic means of centralisation\" pushed forward by the President with the disguise of national security. Despite their ideological differences, the statement was supported by many of the parties in the assembly, most notably both Socialists.\n\nSwiftly, the parliamentary floor descended to arguing and complaints thrown forth by all sides. The chatter was silenced by former President Vasić, who rose from his seat and openly declared Stojadinović to be a \"Codreanite pig\" who does not deserve to lead the Serbian nation, as he will run all the achievements of the Revolution to the ground. After requesting that Vasić leave the session for today for his misconduct, the Speaker finally ordered it adjourned. The Council of National Unification, however, was left dead in the water."
 serbia_events.65.d:9 "Having stabilised his power after the initial chaos, Petar Živković has made an official announcement to the Serbian people today. From here on out, the newly reborn Kingdom of Serbia will be run by a Regency Council, appointed from members of the newly established \"Serbian Radical Peasants' Democracy\", created from the former State Party of Serbian Democrats, members of the White Hand, and former Radicals who opportunistically changed their allegiances. For the duration of the Regency, it shall be the sole legal party in the country, and the Regency will manage all day to day affairs of the state.\n\nAlready, underground Republicans and Socialists have denounced this regime as a dictatorship - not that they were ever going to accept the fall of the Republic."
 serbia_events.67.d1:9 "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, a prominent publication was released in their unofficial newspaper, \"Buđenje\" (\"Awakening\") - it is an anti-semitic, anti-Muslim and an esoteric nationalist creed, proclaiming the Dictatorship of November 6th to be a \"national revolution\" which will \"purify Serbia and restore its pride\". The publication and the newspaper in general call for an authoritarian corporatist system, present the Iron Guard regime in Romania as an example, and spew vehement hatred towards syndicalism, which they describe as completely against Serbian national interest."
 serbia_events.67.d2:9 "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, the White Eagles paramilitary organisation has held a mass rally on the streets of Belgrade, proclaiming their support to the restored Serbian monarchy and calling for the \"national revival\" of the Serbian nation. This rally did not pass without controversy, however. The marchers chanted anti-semitic slogans, called for the expulsion of minorities in Kosovo and Macedonia in order for those lands to be integrated into the Serbian state, and intimidated the general public. Even the military had to get involved to maintain the peace in the city before any riots broke out."
 serbia_events.67.d4:9 "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, a large military parade was held on the streets of Belgrade, the rejuvenated Serbian Army has chosen to showcase both its military might and its loyalty to the monarchy. Famous Serbian military marches were rehearsed and the parade was finished with a dramatic singing of the anthem of the Yugoslavian movement, \"Hej, Sloveni!\". The parade did not go without controversy, however, as underground resistance newspapers claim that the event was held to distract from crackdowns on socialist and republican dissenters across the country."
 serbia_events.73.d:9 "Though the Yugoslav state is fresh, already resentment with the new state of affairs begins to build up — or, rather, a search for an opportunity to accomplish plans sought for many years.\n\nThe only real ideology of the Konspiracija secret society is Serbian supremacism, and the idealistic goals of Yugoslavism and a union of the South Slavs have little place within it. The Serbian Cultural Club has been drafting ideas of a \"Greater Serbia\" instead, one which should be formed after the collapse of the Austrian empire and include all territories inhabited by Serbs, or territories said to be inhabited by Serbs, and perhaps a little bit more...\n\nThankfully, within the past decade, the Serbian Army has gained complete control of the government, eliminating the last barrier between this goal and reality. Within a week after the proclamation of Yugoslavia, a silent coup seized control of the state, overthrew the democratically elected government and reverted the proclamation. Milan Nedić, the elder of the powerful Nedić, has come to power as the provisional president of a greater Serbia.\n\nThough they were officially opposed to the coup and fled to the underground, both the Republicans and the Radicals saw numerous members either support or tolerate the putsch. This severely shook the reputation of both of the parties, and as the coup advances from Belgrade to consolidate the rest of the country, their leaders such as Dragomir Vasić and Milan Stojadinović find themselves unable to organise a serious response."
 serbia_events.77.d:9 "With a swift and sudden stroke, the Bulgarian overlordship over the Balkans has been overthrown. Their so-called \"Greater Bulgaria\" turned out to be a paper tiger - attacked from multiple sides, divided between multiple fronts, it suffered the same fate as it did in 1913. We have once again been reunited with our brethren across the Great Morava, and have even reclaimed the lands of Macedonia, which, in spite of what the locals claim, have always been the heritage of the Serbian Empire. Those who doubted our government's course have been silenced by our tremendous victory, at least for now.\n\nA few less enthusiastic voices claim that our nation will struggle to reintegrate the newly reconquered territories, but they are only a handful and their concerns are generally shunned by the optimists in the parliament in Belgrade."
 serbia_puppet_events.2.d:9 "The party has initiated a series of new reforms to implement their ideas in the country. These reforms will impact the social situation of the country to appease the population. But at the same time they are trying to secure power in Serbia and confront the \"tyranny of the majority\". This concept has been repaired by Alexis de Tocqueville a French politician. He said that the democracy was a vicious circle consisting of the majority the overwhelming majority and not giving a voice to political minorities in a democracy."
 serbia_puppet_events.3.d:9 "Following the debate about the \"tyranny of the majority\", the party has proposed a new reform about implementation of a minimum wage. This proposal would allow every family to have a low income necessary for primary needs. Instead of this, some members of the party propose to implement an insurance system based on Bismarck political ideas of rewarding those who work and contribute for the social security."
 serbia_puppet_events.8.d:9 "Following the meeting, it turned out that the resistant was an outstanding member of the Konspiracija whose objective is to invert Bulgarian hegemony with a stab in the back. Živojin Perić and he decided then to unite Serbian resistance against the Bulgarian oppressor, putting aside all forms of ideological misunderstanding. This union will be called \"Nacionalni Savet Otpora\" (or National Council of Resistance). For the moment we have to gain some support for preparing insurrection against Bulgaria but each decision that we will take will either increase or decrease the stealth of the NCR or independence movement. If our stealth goes too low, we could be discovered and unleash the Bulgarian anger against the Serbian people. If we manage to keep good stealth we can gain some surprise effects against Bulgarian Army.\n\nNow, Perić know that some members of the government are turning against Bulgarian oppression. Shall we try to involve them ?"

 serbia_flavour_events.1.d:9 "The newspapers of Bulgaria are abuzz today with news coming from Serbia — the diplomatic event which many saw as years in the making, a pact between Serbians, Romanians and Greeks, has finally been finalised, and the Belgrade Pact has thus been born. Few view this agreement naively — the Bulgarian political consensus, no matter if it leans left or right, understands that the signatories of the treaty will use it as a weapon against Bulgaria.\n\nSome were more alarmist than others. The largest daily newspaper in Sofia, \"Utro\", printed in large bold letters: \"WAR IS COMING! SERBS MOBILISE TO SEIZE MACEDONIA!\". The alarm came in reference to one of the proclaimed goals of the Congress of Belgrade, which is to \"call for a new order in the Balkans\", which Bulgarian conservatives could only interpret as a call to topple Greater Bulgaria. The same newspaper print also included an article by Nikola Zhekov, general in the Bulgarian Army, who asserted that Bulgaria is completely unprepared to wage a war and the only solution is to immediately plead for mediation from Germany and Austria-Hungary. To work with the Germans, who exploited us so brutally during the Weltkrieg, was considered inconceivable not too long ago, and it might still be, but as of today, anything goes...\n\nSerbian, Turkish and Greek representatives in the National Assembly stood in support of the Pact - the Romanian delegation from constituencies in Dobrudja was more reserved, however. Their equivalent future liberator is the extremist Iron Guard, after all..."
 serbia_flavour_events.3.d:9 "The right wing of the Serbian political spectrum, beyond the People's Radical Party and the Agrarians, is mainly composed of monarchists, and among them two movements are the most notable. The State Party of Serbian Democrats was the sole legal party of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and lingers on as a small moderate monarchist party, concentrated in a few constituencies where they are the strongest, and as they were too insignificant to threaten the republican order, they were allowed to remain legal after the Revolution. The second is a party formed after the Revolution for a new generation of monarchists, named \"Buđenje\" (\"Awakening\"), and its leader, Dimitrije Ljotić, has been slowly making a name for himself.\n\nSpeaking before the Skupština, Ljotić addressed what he perceives the key issues of the Serbian republic — the death of God in a nation overtaken by lust and contempt, and the daily, endless crushing of souls by the \"sledgehammer of capitalism\" which the past governments have enabled with their policies. The politician's esoteric way of speaking convinced few and made him few allies in the legislature, but it was characteristic of the so-called \"Mita Bogomoljac\" (\"Devotionalist Mita\"). Even back when he was an official in King Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and a deputy from Smederevo, Ljotić was unnerving to his peers. He declared his service to the Karađorđević to be divine providence, that the Serbian people to have a God-bestowed mission in the world, and his Orthodox faith was beyond even the fanatical.\n\nLeading a far-right extremist, nationalist royalist party, Ljotić is a minnow on the political stage and so has been allowed to remain for now - but who knows where he might end up if the circumstances change?.."
 serbia_flavour_events.4.d:9 "The news reports are still flying in and the story is still being pieced back together, but here is what is already known.\n\nMajor Živan Knežević, an induct into the Konspiracija secret society and an officer in the Serbian Army, was making his way home in Belgrade alongside a fellow soldier, when the two of them realised that they were being followed. Not wishing to take the risk, the two men hastened their pace, hoping to either come across civilians to use as cover or a phone booth to call the police, but neither came. Instead, the mysterious assailants opened fire, seriously wounding Knežević and killing his peer - wounded, the officer was dragged out of sight and so was the corpse besides him.\n\nIt took the police two days to be informed about the officer's disappearance, and a search across Belgrade was immediately initiated - Knežević was found, but by then, it was already too late, as he was long since dead. Police officers found his corpse in the outskirts of the city, and it was left with a message:\n\n\"Thus unto all enemies of God, the King, and the White Hand!\""
 serbia_flavour_events.5.d:9 "Once again, the law enforcement of the Republic has been mobilised after reports of a committed high profile murder - and this time, it took only a few hours before officers in Kragujevac were met with a horrifying sight in the poor districts of the city - several officers from the Serbian Army, relieved a few years ago because of suspicions that they belonged to the White Hand, stabbed and hanged by their feet publicly. A few children playing football around the block explained that some strange looking men hanged them there not too long ago.\n\nOnly the dimmest failed to realise who was behind these murders. Not only was Major Živan Knežević a respected member of the Serbian Cultural Club and the secret organisation behind it, but he was also the brother of Radoje Knežević, a commander in the Serbian Air Force, a leading member of the Republican Party and the Konspiracija. While the military is understandably silent about the events, and Knežević merely expressed his solemn grief at his brother's death, it's almost certain that these assassinations were made as an act of righteous revenge.\n\nAnd, again, much like everyone expected, the police closed the case a few days later, stating that \"the investigation will pause for the time being as no possible suspect has been found\"."
 serbia_flavour_events.6.d:9 "In the first two decades of the twentieth century, three Balkan Wars shook the region — two were local affairs, fought only between the Balkan states themselves, whereas the third is more commonly known as the Balkan front of the Weltkrieg. For almost two decades after its conclusion, worldwide observers expected it to be the last, too. After all, the Weltkrieg left Bulgaria a hegemon in the Balkans and its three competitors shattered, held down by oppressive peace treaties for having chosen the wrong side, and divorced from much of their core lands. Surely, in a Europe redrawn according to Germany's whim, there is no room for revanchist ambitions in the Balkans.\n\nIt is clear today, as thousands of men across the region take up arms, that those predictions were wrong. Was it the weakness of so-called \"Greater Bulgaria\" which was at fault? Or does the blame fall to Austria and Germany for having grown complacent towards the Balkans and not stopped the rearmament of the Balkan states? By now, the answer does not matter — only bloodshed will ensue.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that the Fourth Balkan War will escalate into a worldwide conflict, as none of the great powers treat it as a proxy war against one another just yet, there are still potential participants in the war lying in wait — and nobody knows what the result of it will be. Can Bulgaria defend its fragile hegemony over the Balkan region and make it stand the test of time? Or will the Belgrade Pact achieve the \"new order in the Balkans\" which it calls for?"
 serbia_flavour_events.7.d:9 "The loss in the Weltkrieg marked a fundamental change in Serbian society, and its culture was no exception. An absolute majority of Serbian males died in the war, and almost a quarter of its total population, while the few who remained had to return to burned homes, looted towns, abandoned farms and broken dreams. To cope, many turned to art to express their frustration and sorrow — and yet, the onset of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship stymied the development of Serbian art and culture under heavy censorship. The Republican Revolution of 1925 let this pent up energy loose, and the following decade has left its mark in Serbian culture as a period of avant-garde art, literature, and cultural critique. Few movements were more exemplary of this period than Zenitism, named after the arts magazine \"Zenit\".\n\nFounded by Ljubomir Micić, Ivan Gol and Boško Tokin, it publishes articles on modern society, art reviews, and cultural publications. While contributors to the magazine are numerous, a common strand of anti-war, anti-nationalist and anti-capitalist thought runs through it — and, above them all, modern, \"western\" society. What was the reason why Serbia suffered so much, Micić and his associates ponder in the pages of Zenit? It is because Serbia, having chosen to abandon its unique Balkan spirit and communal, peaceful culture, sold its soul to a greater European civilisation and the cold, heartless machine of modern capitalism. That machine gave the modern tools of war to Serbia with which she killed itself. Some describe Zenitism as anarcho-primitivist, pointing out their scathing critique of modern technology and its lifeless lifestyle, while others see it as taking their thought too literally.\n\nAs 1936 turns, Zenit and the Serbian avant-garde continue their course, even though, as years pass and memory of Weltkrieg devastation grows duller, they become seen as unpatriotic rather than visionary."
 serbia_flavour_events.9.d:9 "One of the most renown political philosophers and legal professors in the republic of Serbia, Slobodan Jovanović, has published a revision to one of his first works, \"Political and Legal Discussions\" (\"Političke i pravne rasprave\"), and its most important change was the addition of a new preface and introduction. In this preface, Jovanović made a leap forward and described the events of 1925-1926 not as \"the Republican Revolution\", but as \"the second Serbian Revolution\".\n\nThe first Serbian revolution referred to by Jovanović was the famous three-decades-long Serbian Revolution, led by Karađorđe Petrović and numerous other heroes of Serbian history, which happened concurrently with the Greek War of Independence and culminated in the recognition of the vassal Principality of Serbia. It is generally seen as the beginning of modern Serbian history and the first step in its long journey to independence. Jovanović explains his decision to name it \"First\" later in the text — the \"Second\" Serbian Revolution, of the post-Weltkrieg period, should be understood not as an independent event, but as the culmination of the ideals of Karađorđe and the first Serbian revolutionaries.\n\nFrom this initial statement, there are numerous conclusions to be made. The Serbian people live a history marked by redemptive struggle in the name of freedom and liberty, be it for their freedom from foreign oppressors, or their freedom from unjust government. The democracy which they enjoy should not be understood as a Western import, but rather as a development of unique Serbian culture and identity - and vice versa, democracy should be considered a core element of Serbian identity."
 serbia_flavour_events.10.d:9 "The concept of the \"Dinaric Race\", created by Western racial scientists in the late 19th century as a way to classify the peoples of southeastern Europe, had been hijacked by pan-Slavic nationalists since the earliest days. As the most radical current in the Yugoslavism ideology, it describes Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks and Macedonians as a part of a single \"race\", and that the differences between them arose of historical separation rather than any inherent differences.\n\nA notable early supporter of ideas which would later form Dinarism was Jovan Cvijić, Serbian geographer and geologist who used the environmental conditions of the Balkans to describe the formation of this joint South Slavic identity. Across the border from Serbia, these ideas are most prominently developed by the Croat philosopher Vladimir Dvorniković, who declares in his writings that the South Slavs need to unite for mutual interests, much like Germans and Italians in the 19th century. His views include eugenics and cultural blending to build this strong Yugoslav \"race\", and a comprehensive description of unitarist Yugoslavian philosophy. Dimitrije Ljotić and his political party are the closest to propagating the Dinarist line in Serbian politics."
 serbia_flavour_events.11.d:9 "Not long after the beginning of the war against Bulgaria, we have received an unexpected letter from Petar Bojović, the famous commander of the Serbian Army during the Weltkrieg. Of the four Vojvodas — the highest-ranking commanders of the Serbian Army before and during the Weltkrieg, equivalent to Field Marshals — he is the last one still alive, and after over a decade of retirement, he has once again offered his services to the Serbian nation, for what he describes as \"a service in the name of the Fatherland for one last time, while the body still allows it\".\n\nVojvoda Bojović has accrued fame as one of the most skilled military commanders in Serbian history, leading the exiles of the Army after the occupation of Serbia, fighting side by side with the Greeks and French in the Thessaloniki Front, and defeating numerically superior Austrian and Bulgarian forces. While he is eighty years of age and has been out of practice for a long time, our commanders in the Serbian Army advise to accept his enlistment - at least out of sheer respect for the legendary figure, as he was a symbol or a mentor for many of them."
 serbia_flavour_events.12.d:9 "Upon returning to the Serbian Army, Vojvoda Bojović brought with himself a letter, which, according to the general's instruction, was to be given directly to the teenage King, Petar II. Respecting the legendary commander's order, the Regency did as requested, and the King received it without a hitch. It read:\n\n\"To His Majesty, Petar Karađorđević,\n\nHearing the news about your return, I could not be more overjoyed. Your father was a friend of mine and a true patriot, as much as some may try to say otherwise. However, I also understand that a difficult task has been placed upon your shoulders, and it will only grow greater as time passes — I sincerely hope that you will manage to bear it, and become the King which the Serbian people need. You are still young and you never saw your homeland in your life — my peers say that will make you weak, but it makes me hopeful instead. Is there a better way for the Serbs to join the brotherhood of Western nations than through a King who grew up in the West, and understands the crux of their success?\n\nAs you mature, learn, and take up your royal duties, I wish for you to remember one thing. Our soldiers go to war with the battle cry \"For King and Fatherland!\" (\"Za kralja i otadžbinu\"). A Serb will always love his Fatherland - but his love for the King has to be earned. Karađorđe made it clear that the Serbian king serves the good of his people, and to be a good King, you should do follow that advice.\n\nVojvoda Petar Bojović\""
 serbia_flavour_events.13.d:9 "As time passes and Serbia increasingly asserts itself in the world, the question of its future in foreign affairs begins to rise. Once the South Slavs are united and Serbia truly a power to be reckoned with in the region, which foreign alliance shall it join itself with, if any? For a country with its geopolitical position, several choices are available, each one with their ups and downs. The Entente is often mentioned among these discussions - and for some, they may appear to be a natural choice. After all, it was the British and French empires that the Serbs fought side by side with during the Weltkrieg, and their third-power status means that Serbia would be able to more easily stay away of the greatest wars of Europe while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nThese ideas are being squashed by the President, however. Though he has seldom hidden his hatred for the British Empire before, Dragomir Vasić has now made it even more clear to his cabinet and his peers in the Republican-led coalition. Speaking to Nikola Milovanović, the President did not mince his words:\n\n\"There shall be no alliance between Serbia and the British Empire. Not only that, but in a liberated Yugoslavia, I will do everything in my power to establish a department which will study and nurture hatred of the British! I have already told this to Grol, but if I could, I would wage all the little nations in the world to a war against them.\"\n\nEven in their dismantled, exiled state in Canada, the British monarchy symbolised the worst aspects of colonialism and exploitation to Vasić, and he was not going to let it slide."
 serbia_flavour_events.16.d:9 "Though still under the close supervision of the Regency, King Petar II has nonetheless been deemed mature enough to join official state delegations to foreign nations — the first of them being Serbia's neighbour and close ally, Romania. For the young monarch, this was not merely a state visit, either, but a family reunion as well — through his mother Maria, Petar II was the nephew of Carol II of Romania. The assassination of Aleksandar II had thus shaken the Romanian royal family as well, especially once his wife and Carol's sister fled to her homeland.\n\nThe young King's motorcade in Bucharest was greeted by jubilant crowds. Under orders, his vehicle stopped by an assembly of Serbian monarchists exiled in Romania ever since the Republican Era — many of whom had formed close ties with the Iron Guard during the following years, seeing Codreanu's salvationist ideology as the best way to restore Serbia's strength, and so hailed their monarch with a Legionary salute. After official diplomatic ceremonies, Petar was invited to the Royal Palace, where he shook hands with \"Uncle Carol\" and met his cousin, Crown Prince Mihai. The two members of the next generation of Balkan royalty quickly found common ground and left a positive impression on each other, to the point where Petar even offered Mihai to visit Serbia next time."
 serbia_flavour_events.18.d:9 "Under the order of Petar Živković, the Regency government of the Kingdom of Serbia has formed a committee for the drafting of a new Constitution, one which shall be implemented as soon as King Petar II reaches maturity. As it will certainly define the future of the state for years, if not decades, it is a matter of utmost national importance, and as such important monarchist politicians and leading legal scholars alike have been invited to voice their opinions. There are a handful of red lines, however. The consensus among the handpicked delegates from the Radical Peasants' Democracy is that the Constitution must guarantee a strong regime, with a lot of reserve powers for the King and the curtailment of what they describe as \"mob rule\".\n\nThe teenage King, Petar II, has been invited to attend constitutional project discussions as well - and while he is by no means a professional in matters of constitutional law, he does have a vision of his own, inherited from a long time spent in Canada. Though it is unlikely that anyone will listen to him, he has an urge to intervene in the legal discussions and offer more democratic solutions..."
 serbia_flavour_events.20.d:9 "While President Milan Stojadinović and the Radicals under him have managed to form a coalition of the entire right, such a vast \"great\" union comes with its own issues and internal conflicts. One of the most glaring to have begun recently is one between the President and the chairman of the extremist Buđenje political party, Dimitrije Ljotić. Frequently, these two men have been seen conflicting with one another in the halls of the Skupština, their controlling personalities unable to live with one another much like two scorpions could not live in one bottle.\n\nIn speeches before the fellow parliamentarians as well as to the public, Ljotić began speaking out increasingly harsh towards his fellow coalition members, claiming that they have lost the support of the divine and that the sickness of one of the ministers of the cabinet was God's judgment for the heretical and un-Serbian policies enacted by the incumbent government. Needless to say, Buđenje has been kicked out of the coalition after a mere month of participation, but the experience has soured the people's opinion of the government."
 serbia_flavour_events.21.d:9 "Today marks the 25th anniversary of the defence of the city of Belgrade — on October 7th, 1915, Austro-Hungarian and German forces crossed the Sava and Belgrade rivers to engage the undermanned defenders of the city. Despite inferior numbers, equipment, and supplies, the overrun Serbian forces were not outdone and put up the best challenge to the attacking forces as they could.\n\nThe high point of Serbian heroism during the battle came from the Second Battalion of the 10th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Major Dragutin Gavrilović. Alongside with the Belgrade Gendarmerie and local volunteers, they were the first line of defence against the advancing enemy forces and marched to battle with the grim knowledge that they will fall one by one for Belgrade and the Fatherland. In a final act of defiance, Major Gavrilović gave a rousing speech where he announced to his men that their regiment has been erased from the records of the Army, hence there is little for them to do except go forward to glory, for King and Country.\n\nThe valiant defence of the Serbian defenders did not prove to be enough and the White City fell, but under the orders of Field Marshal August von Mackensen, a monument was erected in Austrian-occupied Belgrade, which still says \"Here Rest Serbian Heroes\" and which is the centre of the procession today. Soldiers of the army salute the humble monument and widows of the defenders of Belgrade place flowers before it.\n\nSome would say that their sacrifice was in vain, as Serbia was ultimately subjugated and had to spend almost two decades languishing under Austrian and Bulgarian domination. Others are more apologetic - after all, Serbia has managed to rise from those ashes since, and does that not make up for it?"
 serbia_flavour_events.26.d:9 "The impossible has happened. After a victorious campaign against the Ottoman army, Serbian soldiers march across the streets of Constantinople, admiring the historic buildings and establishing administration for a long military occupation. So little time has passed since the time when Serbia was a minnow in the Balkans, much less the world — now, it reigns over the City of the World's Desire.\n\nFor the Serbian people, Constantinople is not merely a city, it is a symbol. It was supposed to be the crown jewel of Stefan Dušan, the first Tsar of the Serbs, who expanded the medieval Serbian principality to its largest extent, with the dream of crafting a new Roman Empire with the Serbs at its head. Alas, as he mounted a crusade against the Turks, he died prematurely, leading to the collapse of his Empire and the beginning of the end for the Balkans.\n\nFrom there, everyone knows how history went. Though Serbs and the other Slavs fought bravely, resisted, bit back in the fields of Kosovo and elsewhere, they were subjugated one after another, and centuries of despised Turkish yoke followed. Today, the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia have achieved what Tsar Dušan could not, and the Ottoman Empire has been forced to its knees.\n\nAs a symbolic act, King Petar II has been invited to attend the occupation of Constantinople for a brief ceremony — where, inside the Hagia Sophia, he was crowned in the style of the first Tsar as the historical sources tell us, and granted the title of \"Tsar of the Serbs\".

Especially not in Serbia, a country with deep historical and cultural ties with the East Slavic hegemon. A new political treatise with a rather inflammatory name — \"Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?\" — is making rounds across Serbia, and its author is Velibor Jonić.\n\nJonić is a veteran of the Republican Revolution, a politics and history professor who became a member of the Republican Party after the Weltkrieg — he left after the Revolution, however, and temporarily withdrew from politics. A vehement nationalist with authoritarian tendencies, he saw the Revolution as a \"national rebirth\" from a dynasty that failed the Serbs, and the liberal democracy established afterwards did not satisfy his dreams.\n\nIn \"Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?\", Jonić seeks to draw the parallel between the Russian Republic before Savinkov and Serbia, both Slavic states \"of similar spiritual composition\" which were allured by the illusions of liberal democracy after defeat in the war. Russia was hijacked by a dictator following a new ideological creed, which Jonić describes as \"national revolutionary\" — clearly radical and one against the status quo, but an idea which seeks to bring the country back towards where it truly needs to focus, that is, revanchism.\n\nThe question in the treatise's title is rhetorical, Jonić does not provide an answer — however, he writes that he will not only expect the Serbian Revolution to be hijacked, but will also welcome this \"end of the opiate of Serbian people\"."

Now, isolated even more by the massive transformation of the political scene, they have begun to embrace Serbian supremacist rhetoric and the remnants of the dying Monarchist movement. Those in Serbia who did not wish for the formation of Yugoslavia, believing it to be the dilution of an ethnic Serbian state, now find a home within the SRZ. As the Republicans have turned increasingly Yugoslavist, they aim to consolidate the old Serbian population in their competitor's absence.\n\nNew party leadership elections are expected to take place in a month's time, and they will decide the future goals and ideology of the party.

 yugoslavia_events.10.d:9 "The Croatian Party of Rights had initially dissolved after the foundation of Yugoslavia, but has gathered once again, this time with the stated purpose of defending the \"Croatian state right\". The new Belgrade order has deeply affected the Croatian nationalist party. It has allied itself with the Croatian Peasants' Party in order to form the Croatian National Representation, a joint political force, but over time it has increasingly been overtaken by radicalism.\n\nNew cadres in the party, recruited throughout the period, show the tendency for increasingly radical rhetoric - discreetly or even openly endorsing a terrorist campaign against the Yugoslav state in order to evict the Serbs and establish an Independent State of Croatia. This Croatian state should encompass the maximum extent of Croatian claims, including Bosnia and Syrmia, and purified of ethnic minorities.\n\nSuch rhetoric continues spreading among our Croatian population, raising tensions further."
 yugoslavia_events.15.d:9 "The radicalisation of the right-wing of the Croatian Party of Rights ever since the formation of Yugoslavia, and the inability of the government in Belgrade to stabilise the state in time, has finally concluded in the birth of something worrying. No longer appeased by any sort of reconciliation talks or federalist promises, these radicals have organised around the underground magazine \"Insurgent\" (\"Ustaša\"), in which they proclaimed their break with any form of Yugoslavia — as the very first publication of the magazine states, \"only the dagger, revolver, rifle and bomb will herald the resurrection of the Independent State of Croatia\". This publication also announced the formation of the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation, which has taken the mantle of this proclamation.\n\nThe name of the magazine was swiftly adopted by the organisation as a shorthand. It unites the radical new generation of Croatian politicians, former soldiers and officers in the Austro-Hungarian army who refused to integrate into the Yugoslav armed forces, and those who suffered in the Austro-Hungarian-Belgrade Pact war. Some suspect that they may even be aided by remnants of the IMRO, the Croatian insurgents trained in exile in the art of assassination and sabotage. Already, several bombings of loyalist newspaper offices and shootings in Croatian streets have been attributed to the organisation, and peace in Croatia appears to be increasingly fragile."
 yugoslavia_events.16.d4:9 "A circle of philosophers associated with Integral Yugoslavist thought have published a proclamation calling for the centralisation of the state and the erasure of what they describe as \"tribes of one Yugoslav nation\" through determined re-education. Others supporters of Integralism have endorsed the publication, all while criticising Croatian and Slovene separatists. Some of them even appealed to a mystical \"Dinaric race\", a racial group encompassing the Yugoslavs superior to other European races, and the need to unify all South Slavs under this racial structure. Though these theories have gained limited traction across the country, they endorse our government and so can be put to good use."
 yugoslavia_events.17.d2:9 "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia — and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have finally concluded in a mostly comprehensive agreement. From here on out, a vast popular front shall be built from Serbian and Illyrian socialists, the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia, which shall continue the role of the Serbian SRP as the only legal party and guiding force of the socialist state.\n\nNot everyone has agreed with this merger, however. Citing the dedication of Serbian socialists towards a purported \"Serbian\" socialism, French-inspired socialists and trade unionists in Croatia have broken to form a left-wing opposition to the ruling party, the Syndicalist Party. Immediately, as an example of \"leftist deviation\", these Syndicalists have been purged from political posts and workplaces and thus driven underground."
 yugoslavia_events.18.d:9 "After the Vukovar Congress, the newly integrated Illyrian socialists have raised the question of leadership. Trifun Kaclerović, elected as President of Serbia in 1936, has led Yugoslavia thus far, but a Slovene and Croat bloc in the Party has challenged this, stating that while his soft guiding hand has been effective thus far, him staying in power means the perpetuation of Serbian dominance. Should a united Yugoslavia not stray away from that, if it wishes to present itself as a nation for all Yugoslavs?\n\nA coalition of the Bosnian and Croat deputies have proposed Milan Gorkić — Bosnian socialist ideologue of Czech birth who was active in Habsburg-ruled Illyria before the War of Liberation. Gorkić proposes that the national question is just as important for socialist Yugoslavia as the class question. A socialist state must not be an oppressor of peoples, and must represent them — the SRPJ, in his vision, should be reorganised, establishing sub-parties for every major ethnic group, while the country itself must be turned more federal.\n\nThe Serbian faction of the Party, seeking a compromise, has proposed Moša Pijade, well known Serbian socialist writer and ideologue of Sephardic Jewish origin, who has been a key actor in proliferating socialist ideology in the Serbian republic and drafting the ideological tenets of the Serbian SRP. If elected, Pijade calls for an even stricter adherence to socialist doctrine, uniting Yugoslavia above ethnic lines and sweeping the party of \"leftist errors\". Finally, some can still agree to retain Trifun Kaclerović - after all, even the Croats, Slovenes and Bosniaks can respect him..."
 yugoslavia_events.19.d:9 "Several years have passed, and yet Yugoslavia still appears on the brink of ethnic conflict. Increasingly, large sections of the SRPJ have grown frustrated with the government of Milan Gorkić. They have increasingly begun to criticise the party leader as a right-wing deviationist whose policies have proved a failure, and a fairly capable coalition has organised around former member of the Croatian SRP, Josip Broz.\n\nBroz has too denounced Gorkić as a rightist deviationist, claiming that his focus on the national question is clearly born out of his hidden nationalist sympathies. Instead, Yugoslavia should seek to integrate all of the nationalities scattered across the Balkans into one federal, \"Yugoslav\" state - otherwise, it may not survive the following decades. Broz's critics have a lot of ammunition against him, however, as his dedication to socialism is not very doctrinaire, and it is suspected that if he prevails over Gorkić, he will compromise on socialist ideals such as the market economy if pragmatically necessary.\n\nAn extraordinary congress of the Party has been called in Sarajevo, and by the end of the assembly, one side in the party will surely have purged the other."

Daunted by his defeat, Li tried returning to Beijing secretly, but Zhang Zongchang's men intercepted him at the train station and persuaded him to work with the Dogmeat General again.

Many of his family members are members of the Kuomintang remnant in the north, allowing him to serve as a bridge of sorts if need be.\n\nOf course, building a civilian government is another priority of Feng Yuxiang.

 shanxi_endgame_events.16.d.yan:9 "$shanxi_endgame_events.16.intro$\n\nYan Xishan knows all too well how difficult it is to eliminate opium even on a small scale. In 1916 nearly 10% of Shanxi were addicts, causing severe poverty and moral decay. The Society for the Suppression of Opium Smoking was tasked in rooting out the problem, arresting dealers and seizing cargo to price out addicts.\n\nYan brutally fined them, humiliating, and imprisoned addicts, often in work camps where they died of withdrawl. But unable to sustain the prison population and drawing public ire, he switched tracks to rehabilitation - using sanitariums and gradual weaning of drugs instead.\n\nInitially successful in reducing addiction by 80%, the soaring prices meant enterprising opium merchants found a lucrative market in Shanxi, sometimes escorted by warlord troops of neighbouring provinces. In the end, Yan caved and tried creating a government monopoly on the drug, ostensibly selling \"medicine\" to cure addiction. Magistrates were given hundreds of kilos of such \"medicine\" to sell (losing their jobs if they failed), though ultimately Yan was outcompeted even in this regard by an influx of foreign \"pills of immortality\" (a mix of heroin and morphine)."
 shanxi_endgame_events.16.d.feng:9 "$shanxi_endgame_events.16.intro$\n\nFor Feng Yuxiang, this problem is a very personal one - his impoverished parents were both addicts and wasted away what little money they had on the drug. Feng has made it is quest to seek its elimination, and like many see opium as emblematic of China's descent into moral (and practical) corruption. Fighting addiction also takes a nationalistic bent: Questions 18 and 19 of the Guominjun catechism blames the start of foreign \"browbeating\" on the English's \"forcible introduction of opium into the country\".\n\nIn his career, Feng Yuxiang has often ordered the total ban of opium, arresting dealers and establishing expert-run sanitariums as a progressive means of curing the problem.\n\nStill, this has not always been successful, thorough or even implemented for long. The wealthy were given lax treatment, with the focus primarily being on giving poor addicts a trade. Feng often found himself tapping into the lucrative taxation of the opium trade, and like other warlords sometimes the Opium Suppression Bureaus were used to help raise money for the cash-strapped army."
 shanxi_endgame_events.27.d:9 "Yan Xishan has always been a man on the move, someone who has never hesitated to act when it comes to modernising Shanxi and now modernising China. The Young China Party have similarly always been keen on progress and they have searched far and wide for a strong leader who could enact their agenda. It is no wonder that they have been so quick to form a symbiotic relationship; though the Young China Party has sought the sponsorship of figures such as Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, Yuan Zuming, and Zhang Zuolin, few can quite compare to the \"Model Governor\" of Shanxi. Likewise, Yan Xishan has craved a vehicle for harnessing the masses, a party that can mobilise the people to support their leader.\n\nTogether they have created a Party-State, a powerful integration of party, government, and army all under Yan Xishan's purview. And yet, Yan Xishan has  thus far refrained from joining the YCP itself, despite offers (of varying degrees of sincerity) to allow him to be their Chairman. This has kept the YCP nominally out of the Presidential Mansion, though at this point some may debate the wisdom of doing so. Perhaps Yan is afraid their demagoguery will ultimately reflect badly on him, or maybe he does not wish to be in their debt. Yan has always been suspicious of political parties and mass movements, but maybe that is because he has not found the right one yet. Regardless, the opportunity has presented itself: one final step in creating a new China."

 SIK_zhang_peiyuan_army_chief_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §L1894, in Guide Office, Xining District, Qing Empire§!\n§YBackground:§! §LHaving completed his studies in the Gansu Military Tutoring Corps, Zhang Peiyuan, who frequently faced financial difficulties, arrived in Xinjiang from Lanzhou in 1912 to escape debt. While he managed to secure a sinecure under Yang Zengxin, he soon had to leave the province as his store in Dihua, which aimed to provide him with more income, only added to his debts.\n\nIn 1917, recognising that he could only utilise his skills to make a living in Xinjiang, Zhang offered his services to Yang Zengxin and was appointed as the commander of a cavalry company in Altay, located north of Xinjiang. His fortunes took a turn when a group of defeated Russian soldiers entered Altay during the Russian Civil War. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Zhang successfully deceived the Russian soldiers by creating the illusion that the Chinese army was well-prepared and adequately manned, using military hats placed on rocks in the trenches. Leveraging his intrigue skills, Zhang even negotiated the departure of the Russian soldiers by employing a merchant with a striking resemblance to a former governor in Xinjiang, pretending that he is an official envoy. These audacious acts not only safeguarded his position but also earned him significant recognition from Yang Zengxin, leading to his promotion as a regimental commander. Subsequently, Zhang was appointed as a tutor at the Dihua Military Academy and became a prominent military figure in Xinjiang.§!\n\n§YNotes: This ambitious officer staunchly opposes any form of foreign influence or intervention in Xinjiang and is prepared to defend his position against any threats.§!"

This aspirational cadet furthered his military education at the Baoding Military Academy and his training was put into practice during the Xinhai Revolution, where he served as a commander of the revolutionary forces in Hanyang and Shanghai, contributing to China's greatest revolution.\n\nIn 1913, Niu was sent to Xinjiang province and was appointed to various defence positions in the past two decades by Yang Zengxin. In 1915, as the chief of staff of Yang Feixia, the Defence Commissioner of Ili, Niu was appointed Chief of the Military Surveying Bureau of Ili and entrusted with handling Sino-Russian border affairs. Due to his commendable service, Niu Shi was became the acting Commissioner of Defence of Ili in 1920 after Yang Feixia resigned from the post. His position in Xinjiang remained secure as this able officer, who attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1927, received much recognition from both superiors and colleagues.§!\n\n§YNotes: Having spent two decades in Ili, Niu compiled \"Military Geography of Ili\", which introduces the mountainous military geography of the area in detail.

After finishing his studies in logistics, he returned to China and took part in the Second Guangzhou Uprising and the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Before being sent to Xinjiang by the Nanjing provisional government to sway Yang Zengxin in the next year, Yang served as a staff of Dr Sun and a brigade commander.\n\nServing briefly as the chief of staff of Yang and the Xinjiang governorate, Yang Feixia was then appointed Defence Commissioner of Ili, with Niu Shi as his chief of staff, together they successfully settled the Russian population entered Xinjiang during the catastrophic Russian Civil War. Despite being his relatives, Yang Feixia, who had divergences over administration and military direction with the governor, realised that Yang Zengxin was increasingly suspicious towards his countrymen, he thus resigned from his post in 1921. Since then, Yang Feixia has been holding an advisory military sinecure in the province as he was never allowed to leave. Yet, his military capability is commended by his colleagues.§!\n\n§YNotes: Yang inspects the barracks incognito often, it is said that once he was refused to enter the city at late night, he crossed the city walls with merely a dagger, and the sentries who refused to let him in were awarded the next day.§!"

In 1912, he enrolled in the 3rd Class of the Baoding Military Academy to study infantry, marking the beginning of his military career.\n\nAfter graduating in August 1916, Li was deployed to Shaanxi but was soon reassigned to Xinjiang Province under Yang Zengxin, where he served as a junior officer. A diligent and capable serviceman, he quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed by Yang as the Commander-in-Chief of a border garrison unit in northern Xinjiang. There, he devoted himself to training young officers. In 1928, Li was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the garrison units in Hami and appointed both the military and civilian head of Tacheng, guarding the province's border against bandit incursions.

By 1918, he left behind his life as a school teacher and would go to work with Zhang Zuolin. Using flattery, Qiu was able to convince Zhang to send him to the Baoding Army Officer School for study. Upon completion, Qiu would serve under Guo Songling as a regimental commander. Obedient and submissive, Qiu would follow orders and did not stand out considerably as a leader. Around this time he met Sheng Shicai, who would eventually marry Qiu's second daughter Qiu Yufang. In November of 1925, Guo Songling unsuccessfully revolted from Zhang Zuolin. With the failure of this defection all of Guo's troops, including Qiu, would be reorganised into different units within the Fengtian Army.\n\nBy the end of the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War in 1928, Qiu was dismissed from the army in Shenyang. Being unemployed for multiple years, Qiu would wander around the city and when the opportunity arose, head to a brothel. Offered by Sheng Shicai to move to Xinjiang and to act as an envoy for Ili land reclamation, Qiu would move to the region in 1931.\n\nNow Secretary-General of the Border Supervisory Office, Qiu's greed is almost as great as his brutality. Confiscating property without any reason, using public funds improperly and arbitrary executions, Qiu acts with almost full impunity knowing that his son-in-law provides him protection. As long as he has this protection, Qiu will continue to live a decadent lifestyle and with it maintain his reputation as a cruel butcher in Xinjiang.§!\n\n§YNotes: Despite Qiu Zhongjun's frequent embezzlement and amassing of wealth, he remains parsimonious.

 SWI_country_intro_content:9 "The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the Catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a federal state with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the Bundesrat (Federal Council), Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court).\n\n Switzerland remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition, economic problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1919 a strike in Geneva called for by the worker's movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed because of the fear of spreading of French syndicalism and its subsequent repression by Swiss government, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days.\n\nIn 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s, domestic politics were governed in response to the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. The struggles between communities in Switzerland are now taking more political values: French-speakers are more socialist, Germans more conservative and Italians more clerical.\n\nWill the rising belligerence in Europe have consequences on the neutral Confederation?"

 switzerland_events.34.d:9 "After the recent Syndicalist revolution rocked our small eastern neighbour, many assumed it would only be a matter of time before they joined the Third Internationale.\n\nToday is that day, as Swiss diplomats have officially requested that the nation be allowed into our alliance."
 switzerland_events.36.d:9 "Despite the fact that we share ideological similarities as well as a land border, the French have refused to accept us into their international alliance.\n\nFor what reason could they have they done this?"
 switzerland_events.37.d:9 "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to join our military alliance.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.38.d:9 "Our diplomat to Berlin has sent news that Germany has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance and welcomed us with open arms.\n\nWe are now a proper member state of the Reichspakt."
 switzerland_events.39.d:9 "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Germany with regards to our acceptance into the Reichspakt.\n\nIt seems that the Germans are keen on keeping us out of their alliance."
 switzerland_events.45.d:9 "The recent run on the Berlin Stock Exchange is not without consequences for Switzerland. The Swiss economy relies heavily on German trading and the collapse of the German markets has sent immediate shock-waves through the Swiss economy.\n\nWe must act if we are to save our economy from total collapse."
 switzerland_events.46.d:9 "Responding to our calls for Europe's best and brightest to join our research initiative in Vienna, our friends the Swiss have responded favourably and have sent a handful of researchers to contribute to our initiative.\n\nTogether we will make great discoveries in the name of scientific advancement."
 switzerland_events.48.d:9 "Emotions were largely muted at the official signing of the papers that would make the new Helvetic Commune the official government in Switzerland, cementing the power of Syndicalism in governmental structure for the foreseeable future.\n\nDrawing on inspiration from the Helvetic Republic of old, the new Directorate promises to lead the Swiss people in a fashion that will benefit all Swiss people, and uphold their values for decades to come."
 switzerland_events.49.d:9 "Thunderous applause from the steps of the capital building as Jakob Herzog was sworn in as the first and sole Director of the new Helvetic Commune.\n\n Rising to prominence on a wave of popularity due to his advocacy of the \"Strong Hand\" approach to revitalising Switzerland, the new Director has made promises that the mistakes of old will not be repeated, and that the new Helvetic Commune will stand tall as a proper power in Europe."
 switzerland_events.50.d:9 "With the foundation of a new government and a new future for Switzerland, a motion has been put forward to move the nation's official capital from its old seat in Bern to a more appropriate location in Geneva.\n\nThe Genenva Council of State has been handling the government's duties effectively so far, and Geneva has long been the centre of Syndicalist movements in Switzerland. Many feel that this move would cement Switzerland's future as a proper Syndicalist nation. What should we do?"
 switzerland_events.51.d:9 "The time has come again for the people of Switzerland to vote, and decide which party will seize the majority in the National Council.\n\nOnly one party can come out on top, which will it be?"
 switzerland_events.51.f:9 "Bauern-, Gewerbe- und Bürgerpartei!"
 switzerland_events.52.d:9 "With the French bearing down upon us, we must look to our neighbours for assistance in the defence of Switzerland.\n\nFacing down the might of the French Commune is no easy task, and it is unlikely that we will be defended, but we must try all the same."
 switzerland_events.54.d:9 "Earlier today envoys from Switzerland arrived to plead for Austrian backing against French threats to seize the Romandie region.\n\nWhile we have little to gain from supporting such a venture, throwing our support behind the Swiss cause could boost our prestige worldwide and show the French that the Austrian Empire is not to be trifled with. Backing the Swiss in such a manner would certainly place them in our debt..."
 switzerland_events.56.d:9 "In response to the brewing conflicts in Romandie and Haute-Savoie, the Austrian Empire has officially declared its support of the Swiss people against us.\n\nIf we are to continue forward with our demands against the Swiss, it could result in a conflict of arms against Austria. The Austrians are a power to be reckoned with, can we afford a war so early?"
 switzerland_events.60.d:9 "Despite our best efforts to gain international support for our cause, it seems that no nation is willing to stand for justice against the imperialism of the French Commune.\n\nWe have been abandoned by our neighbours, and there is no choice left but to give in to the French demands. We cannot hope to win on our own."
 switzerland_events.61.d:9 "Despite our initial intentions of only inciting revolt in Haute-Savoie, it seems that our efforts to destabilise Switzerland have exceeded our wildest expectations. Rather than stopping in the Western cantons and holding their ground, revolutionary forces have instead advanced east, bolstered by local support and army defections.\n\nThese forces have successfully toppled the Federal Government in Bern, and are now looking to us for support of their new government."
 switzerland_events.62.d:9 "What initially appeared as fringe uprising in the Western cantons has spread like wildfire east, with Syndicalist supporters rising to support an ever-growing flood of revolutionary sentiment that has swept through the nation.\n\nThe army, feebly led and unwilling to take decisive action against the civilians, has been wholly ineffective at stopping their march on the capital. As the sun rises, a new, Syndicalist government claims control of the nation."
 switzerland_events.63.d:9 "With the rising escalations in the Romandie and Haute-Savoie regions and France's seeming willingness to intervene in our internal affairs, the situation in Haute-Savoie looks grim.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before the situation spirals out of our control. We must prepare for the worst."
 switzerland_events.64.d:9 "Sensing our apparent weakness and willingness to surrender to their terms, France has responded to our offer to surrender Haute-Savoie with incredulity, informing us that our response is \"insincere\" and obviously insufficient to guarantee the rights of Syndicalist supporters not only in Romandie, but in the whole of Switzerland.\n\nThey have offered to send \"advisors\" to our nation in order to ensure that the proper reforms are passed \"for the good of all Swiss peoples\"."
 switzerland_events.65.d:9 "After we properly informed the Swiss that their proposal to cede Haute-Savoie was not in our best interests, they have further shown their weakness and aversion to conflict by agreeing to our proposals of instituting reforms in the nation to protect the rights of Syndicalists in the nation.\n\nNo doubt these reforms will lead to the eventual supremacy of Syndicalism in the nation, and the Swiss will surely drift into our own sphere of influence."
 switzerland_events.66.d:9 "Despite our best efforts to both gain international support for our cause and prevent any bloodshed, both our trustworthy ally and France have both refused to back down.\n\nIt seems that we must fight to maintain our independence from French aggression."
 switzerland_events.69.d:9 "We have received suspicious reports of large meetings of military officers meeting late in the evenings, and long into the night.\n\nWhile this is not a cause for concern in and of itself, the fact that all of these men are members of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has caused some in the National Council to take note. Could the officers be planning something?"
 switzerland_events.70.d:9 "In times of peace and stability the highest attainable rank in the Swiss military is that of Lieutenant General, although the role is more of a Senior Colonel than a General.\n\nOnly in times of great need or looming military conflict is a man promoted to the rank of General in order to lead the defence of the nation. Now that we have been thrust into a time of great crisis, it is time for us to select a General to lead the command of our armed forces."
 switzerland_events.71.d:9 "Earlier today fringe Syndicalist paramilitaries \"Die Arbeiterwache\" held a rally in the streets of Geneva against the \"wilful suppression\" of the Swiss workers by the current government. While such a fringe rally would normally be of no concern, the sheer amount of people in attendance has caught the government's eye.\n\nThousands of people were in attendance, seemingly hanging on every word of the main speaker, Jakob Herzog. It seems that Syndicalist sentiment is more prevalent in the West than we previously thought."
 switzerland_events.74.d:9 "Despite not directly asking for their backing, it seems that the German Kaiser has seen the need to protect the order in Europe, and has intervened on our behalf against the Syndicalist menace.\n\nCould this turn the tide against the French hordes?"
 switzerland_events.75.d:9 "Despite the Swiss not asking for their assistance, the German Kaiser, delusional in his power, has seen fit to throw his nation into war against our glorious crusade.\n\nSurely this is the end of Germany's reign over Europe."
 switzerland_events.76.d:9 "Despite our best efforts to avoid foreign entanglements, Switzerland has found itself caught up in the machinations of foreign powers.\n\nOur neutrality, maintained for over a hundred years, has finally been broken as our government has been brought into alignment with [SWI.faction_leader.GetNameDef]"
 switzerland_events.79.d:9 "Despite our best efforts to avoid foreign entanglements and conflicts, Switzerland has found itself embroiled in a war.\n\nOur neutrality, maintained for over a hundred years, has finally been broken as men young and old are called up in service of their country."
 switzerland_events.89.d:9 "After many long weeks of innocence and guilt, the trials of the Swiss Officer Corps are completed, and many have been either exonerated or retired.\n\nThis process has ensured that the new Swiss military is one loyal to the state, but at what cost..."
 switzerland_events.91.d:9 "After the widely publicised show trianls in Bern, the government has almost nothing to show for their efforts. We failed to prosecute any officers of note, and the people have taken us to be utter buffoons. How could we hold such trials and make no convictions?"
 switzerland_events.92.d:9 "Months have passed, and a new generation of officers loyal to the state have entered the military.\n\nMonth by month, the effects of the Bern Trials on our military effectiveness fade."
 switzerland_events.100.d:9 "With the bloodless resolution of the crisis in Haute-Savoie, Syndicalist agitations within the borders of our nation have faded. Old grudges have begun to be forgotten and a new period of unity is dawning.\n\nThose who remain as Syndicalist supporters have mostly begun resorting to more peaceable forms of political activism, and the political tension that once gripped the country is no more."
 switzerland_events.101.d:9 "Despite increasing tensions between ourselves and the French commune over the status of Haute-Savoie, today we have learned that the French government has suddenly dropped all plans to incense activism inside of Switzerland.\n\nIt seems that the government in Paris has become dissuaded from pursuing the matter further, content to simply rattle its sabre. We have dodged what could have become a major international crisis."
 switzerland_events.103.d:9 "For many months, the regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie have been gripped by tension as Swiss socialists have petitioned the Commune of France for annexation and intervention in order to unite the French speaking peoples under one banner. However, it appears that despite initial threats against the stability of the Swiss nation, no intervention seems forthcoming from the Commune.\n\nLacking a serious supporter and seemingly acting against the wishes of the greater Swiss nation, today Syndicalist leaders have met with the Federal government for what appears to be the first of many negotiations to end the hostilities. It seems that peace has won the day, the crisis is over."
 switzerland_events.104.d:9 "Despite the earlier opportunity to support the French-speaking regions of Switzerland against their capitalist oppressors, we have not found supporting their movement in our best interests.\n\nNow news has come from Switzerland that Syndicalist revolutionaries in the nation, disheartened at our lack of support, have decided to enter formal negotiations with the Swiss federal government. Whatever comes of these talks, our chance to intervene has passed."
 switzerland_events.105.d:9 "Now that the crisis in Haute-Savoie has passed without bloodshed, there are many who have seen the extreme dangers of having an unfriendly power such as the Commune of France right on our border.\n\nThe Federal Government has decided the only way to rectify this situation is to improve bilateral relations between ourselves and the French. An diplomatic mission has been sent to the Commune to attempt to defuse the hostilities."
 switzerland_events.106.d:9 "Swiss diplomats arrived today in Paris to discuss the state of relations between our two countries.\n\nPreviously our two states were on opposite sides of the Savoyard Crisis, but now that the crisis is behind us, it seems that the Swiss are eager to get in our good graces."
 switzerland_events.107.d:9 "Despite the earnest efforts of our diplomatic team to the French Commune, the French seem unwilling to negotiate with us on restoring friendly relations.\n\nWe will have to remain vigilant on our shared border."
 switzerland_events.109.d:9 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the concession of Haute-Savoie to the Commune.\n\nThe Commune has declared that as the one and only legal French government, we are obligated to return Haute-Savoie under the terms of the Congress of Vienna. How should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.110.d:9 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the cession of Romandie to the Commune.\n\nFrance has claimed that the French-speaking majority, rife with Syndicalist supporters, belongs as a proper part of the French nation. How should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.111.d:9 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by an agreement to economic concessions.\n\nAny trade deal we sign with the French will be required to assist them more than it assists us. How should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.116.d:9 "After agreeing to the initial French demands, the ball is now in our court.\n\nRather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
 switzerland_events.117.d:9 "The French have agreed to negotiate with us, and have made no unreasonable demands of us in the process!\n\nRather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"
 switzerland_events.118.political:9 "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation. Both of our nations will open an official embassy with the other and trade will be restored.\n\nBoth nations promise to foster improved relations with the other. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 switzerland_events.118.techno:9 "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of technological cooperation.\n\nBoth of our nations will cooperate on technological development with the other and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 switzerland_events.118.economo:9 "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation.\n\nBoth of our nations will cooperate on economic development and trade will be restored. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 switzerland_events.118.nothin:9 "The Swiss have returned to the discussion with an offer of political cooperation.\n\nTrade will be restored between our two nations. With this new deal, both of our nations will gain from the deal."
 switzerland_events.119.d:9 "Despite the political and military differences between ourselves and the Swiss, the negotiations have gone a long way towards restoring normal relations.\n\nWe will see how the fruits of these negotiations fare in the coming months."
 switzerland_events.136.d:9 "In what was widely considered by the High Command to be a quick and easy war, we have found ourselves on the back foot in our fight against the Swiss and their Austrian defenders.\n\nIn order to save face in the international community, many have suggested we sue for peace immediately before our ineptitude on the battlefield becomes internationally observed."
 switzerland_events.138.d:9 "Switzerland has responded favourably to our request for a settled peace, it seems that they are as eager to end the war as we are.\n\nAll land gained or lost during the course of the conflict is to be returned to its original owner, and both sides are to return and lick their wounds. The war is over."
 switzerland_events.140.d:9 "Despite our generous offer of peace in the face of the Swiss advance, we have received news that the Swiss are refusing any and all offers of peace.\n\nIt seems that the mad Swiss are so confident in their invincibility that they think they can defeat the whole Commune. We will take pleasure in destroying these fools."
 switzerland_events.144.t:9 "KVP and BGB Leave the Bourgeois Block"
 switzerland_events.144.d:9 "The Bourgeois Block, the informal alliance of the popular Market Liberal FDP with the BGB and KVP conservative parties, has long stood as the most stalwart of Swiss political institutions, working to ensure that conservative interests are satisfied and that aggressive Radical Socialist and Syndicalist parties remain marginalised. Today that relationship was severed as the Conservative People's Party (KVP) and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens (BGB) announced their loss of confidence in FDP's ability to handle the economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster.\n\nWith Switzerland's greatest political parties beginning to fight amongst themselves rather than against socialism, there will be room for smaller parties to make their move."
 switzerland_events.163.d:9 "With the new provisional military government in control of the nation, a proclamation has come from Bern that all Syndicalist organisations operating in the country, legally or otherwise, are to be immediately dissolved. This proclamation has been met with a surprising amount of popular support, as the remaining population of the country rallies against Syndicalist \"traitors\"."
 switzerland_events.164.d:9 "An agreement has been made to allow for economic supplies to flow from Mitteleuropa into Switzerland to keep the nation afloat.\n\nHowever, while this temporary arrangement is supporting our economy for now, perhaps we should consider full membership in Germany's economic bloc?"
 switzerland_events.165.d:9 "With the German economy in freefall, the prices of many agricultural goods have fallen with it. Swiss farmers, heavily reliant on trade with Germany, have been hit hard almost overnight, and many have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction over the issue.\n\nThe BGB (Party of Farmers, Traders and Citizens) who represents the interests of many Swiss farmers, and Social Conservative KVP (Conservative People's Party) have begun wavering in their commitment to the current governing alliance of Conservative and Market Liberal parties."
 switzerland_events.167.d:9 "With the Federal Government in Bern so adamantly opposed to the Socialist plans for reform, a movement has gained popularity for an organised referendum on sovereignty in Haute-Savoie. The Socialists believe that if the Savoyards can be shown to wish reunification with the Commune of France, then the government will have to support their plans.\n\nBern has caught wind of this illegal referendum taking place in the region soon, and has vowed that such a vote outside of the law will not be allowed to take place."
 switzerland_events.169.d:9 "Days after the violence in Savoie, the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland has declared that the results of the referendum are in and the region has voted to rejoin the Commune of France. In the chaos, it is impossible to verify the integrity of the vote, and the Socialists, who hold the ballots, have not offered to hand anything over to the federal government.\n\nMany in Bern doubt the validity of the Socialist claim, but it has increasingly seemed like a shouting match between two sides that won't back down..."
 switzerland_events.170.d:9 "Reports have come to Paris bearing news of the violent oppression of Syndicalist freedom fighters in Haute-Savoie who were attempting to organise a referendum on the region's return to French governance.\n\nThe Swiss government in Bern has sent a military force to suppress the vote, and violence has broken out over the legality of the referendum. We can't ignore this violence against our people!"
 switzerland_events.171.d:9 "With no nation willing to defend Switzerland, and our government's weakness exposed for all the world to see, the local governments in Romandie, reinstated by French demands, have quickly voted to secede from the Swiss Confederation and join the Commune of France.\n\nWe are powerless to stop them."
 switzerland_events.173.d:9 "With the transition of the Swiss State to a more orderly regime under the guidance of the military, many have proposed the creation of a new national flag to represent the new order.\n\nA few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
 switzerland_events.174.d:9 "A new era has dawned for the Swiss people under the new Syndicalist regime, and with it comes the need for a new national symbol and flag.\n\nA few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
 switzerland_events.175.d:9 "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to formalise our current relationship and join our new military alliance.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.175.d_war:9 "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland requesting we formalise our de-facto relationship, and allow them membership in our new military alliance.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 switzerland_events.176.d:9 "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcome us with open arms.\n\nWe now have a proper protector against any further untoward aggression."
 switzerland_events.177.d:9 "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Austria with regards to a formalisation of our current impromptu alliance.\n\nIt seems that the Austrians are keen on keeping us out of their alliance, whatever reason they may have."
 switzerland_events.178.d:9 "With French support and a lax military presence in the region, French saboteurs have managed to stir unrest in Haute-Savoie, and the administration will be forced to spare extra resources to maintain the peace.\n\nWe must maintain a stronger military presence if we are to keep the region stable."
 switzerland_events.179.d.war:9 "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe.\n\nWith the largest threat to our nation now a thing of the past, we no longer have to worry about the looming threat of war."
 switzerland_events.179.d.cooperation:9 "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe.\n\nUnfortunately for us, it means whatever we gained from cooperating with them is also gone... but, on the other hand, we no longer have to worry about their influence or the threat of a war."
 switzerland_events.180.d:9 "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France and a restoration of a legitimate French government, it is time we honour our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Haute-Savoie to French control.\n\nWe have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the French government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
 switzerland_events.180.italian:9 "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France, and the consolidation of Savoy under the new Italian regime, it is time we end our custodianship of the territory of Haute-Savoie.\n\nWe have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to the Treaty of Turin of 1816 remains true. The territory's neutrality is no longer threatened, and the new Italian government will surely appreciate the legitimacy of being seen as the territory's legitimate nation."
 switzerland_events.180.syndie:9 "The old Swiss order has been overthrown, and in its place a new and proper Syndicalist government has arisen.\n\nIn order to solidify our relation with our neighbouring Syndicalist Commune of France, we must make good on a promise made many years ago and return Upper Savoy to Communard rule. With this act of cooperation, we can surely align ourselves with the power that is France."
 switzerland_events.181.d:9 "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Upper Savoy to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades.\n\nThey have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of protecting the territory until peace is restored, have properly returned the region to us."
 switzerland_events.184.d:9 "Many officers have resigned out of protest in response to our declaration of Martial Law in the nation.\n\nPerhaps driven by some remaining loyalties to Syndicalist elements operating within our borders, these officers will leave a hole in our ranks that can only be filled with time."
 switzerland_events.185.d:9 "We have been informed that the nationalist regime in Switzerland has nationalised all foreign-owned economic assets in their nation in an attempt to gain greater control over their economy.\n\nNaturally, we have not-insignificant holdings there, and we are under pressure to regain the lost capital for our citizens."
 switzerland_events.186.d:9 "Not even a year after toppling the old Swiss government and establishing a military dictatorship \"for the good of the nation\", the government of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has shown itself completely incapable of rallying public support.\n\nAn increasing amount of public protests have culminated in a storming of governmental offices in the capital and the seizing of key areas by mutinous military units in league with the uprising.\n\nEugen Bircher is missing, as are many of the officers involved in the coup, but for now a new government has been created from more moderate conservatives in the government until the old Federal Government can be properly restored."
 switzerland_events.187.d:9 "An outpost in Mittelland, not responding to radio contact, was today discovered to have been attacked and raided by an unknown enemy. It is theorised the attackers were Syndicalist sympathisers, looking to arm themselves with the weapons stored at the location.\n\nThe men defending the outpost were found to have been killed defending it. We must avenge their deaths."
 switzerland_events.188.d:9 "Gunfire rang out in the early morning today in Bern as unidentified gunmen attempted to attack a military patrol moving through the streets.\n\nThe gunmen were killed without military casualties, but the shock of the incident has rattled citizen's trust in our control of internal affairs."
 switzerland_events.190.d:9 "While our recent military activities have been successful in quashing resistance across the nation, especially in urban areas, it has been proposed that we increase our military presence in the more rural regions of Switzerland as well.\n\nThese are the regions most difficult to maintain order in, and it would require a significant increase in manpower to cover these areas."
 switzerland_events.191.d:9 "Our recent decision to oust foreign agents from the nation has driven many to the frontiers to hide and work against the state.\n\nIn recent days these fighters have been in numerous battles against military forces patrolling in these areas, and casualties have mounted among our forces."
 switzerland_events.192.d:9 "Despite the continual efforts of Syndicalist partisans to sabotage our efforts to maintain peace and order, we have successfully identified and crushed all major sources of resistance and potential dangers to the government.\n\nWith this, a new era of peace can be ushered in."
 switzerland_events.193.d:9 "The rising tide of anti-French sentiment has manifested itself in recent days in a string of violence and harassment against the significant French-speaking population remaining in the nation.\n\nThis divide has caused a wave of citizens to flow over the border into the French-occupied Haute-Savoie, and the military is struggling to clamp down on some of the more extreme cases of discrimination in the countryside."
 switzerland_events.194.d:9 "Unable to accept the truth of a unified France under a Syndicalist regime, the reactionary government of Switzerland has begun a new campaign of persecution against the population of French-speaking Swiss still within their borders.\n\nThis has resulted in a flow of migrants over the border into our nation, and many have shown an interest in taking up arms for an eventual liberation of their homeland from the reactionary menace."
 switzerland_events.197.d:9 "Eugene Bircher's political militias helped us prevent syndicalist subversion before the coup, but many in the government are questioning the use of the militias now.\n\nBircher has committed to disbanding many of the militias, however it is the choice of the government whether to simply encourage the conscription of militia personnel into our military, or to take a more direct approach."
 switzerland_events.198.d:9 "While Switzerland has acted liberally towards immigration in the past, the danger to our nation is too great to allow this unrestrained migration to continue.\n\nOur government has already decreed that we must address this issue; the time has come to amend our immigration policy."
 switzerland_events.199.d:9 "Due to the large pro-German bias that was present in the old government, Eugen Bircher was able to take a high-ranking position in the army.\n\nHowever, it has become apparent that his loyalty has never been to Switzerland and he has since fled to Germany along with some other capitalist refugees, too afraid to allow themselves to be judged fairly for their crimes against the Swiss people."
 switzerland_events.201.d:9 "While Major General Bircher fled after the revolution, many of his brothers-in-arms have opted to stay. Their remaining in Switzerland demonstrates a great level of faith and loyalty to our nation, and their experience in the army would be invaluable to our efforts to rebuild the military.\n\nHowever, their involvement with the old guard of the military has made their status controversial among hardline revolutionaries. The possibility of removing them though is out of the question, and instead it is perhaps best that we take on a more militant posture."
 switzerland_events.211.d:9 "Campione has been part of Italy since Roman times, but since the War of the Holy League in the early sixteenth century it has been entirely surrounded by Swiss land.\n\nMore recently, it has been under our administration and protection since the Italian Civil War, under an arrangement made with the collapsing Kingdom of Italy in 1919. Now that the Italians have reunified their nation again, both the Italian diplomat and the mayor of Campione have requested a meeting with us regarding its future. We plan to..."
 switzerland_events.212.d:9 "Our government has scored a minor diplomatic triumph as Switzerland has recently decided to return Campione, a formally Italian exclave in Ticino, back to us.\n\nThe lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in the 1919 - now that our country is reunified again, the Swiss found no reason to keep Campione away from us any longer."
 switzerland_events.212.d_ref:9 "Our government has scored a minor diplomatic triumph as Switzerland has decided to return the control of Campione, a formally Italian exclave in Ticino, back to us again after a plebiscite.\n\nThe lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in the 1919 - now that our country is reunified again, the people of Campione have once again decided via plebiscite to be Italian."
 switzerland_events.213.d:9 "Violence erupted on the street in front of the Swiss consulate in [159.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today after Switzerland decided to annex Campione, an Italian exclave in Ticino.\n\nThe lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in 1919. Now that our country is reunified again with a government they found hostile, the Swiss found no reason to continue their ruse any longer, and have annexed the commune into Ticino."
 switzerland_events.213.d_ref:9 "A nationalist protest was held solemnly on the street in front of the Swiss consulate in [159.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today after Switzerland decided to annex Campione, an Italian exclave surrounded by Ticino, following a plebiscite in the commune.\n\nThe lakeside commune in question was temporarily put under Swiss protection following the start of the Italian Civil War in 1919. Even though our country is reunified again, the people of Campione have collectively decided to officially join Switzerland as a canton instead."
 switzerland_events.216.d:9 "The people of the commune of Campione, when last consulted on their fate in 1814, they voted against being annexed into Switzerland. However, given the nature of the Italian reunification, some in both our government and that of Campione believe this vote might be different.\n\nAfter a vigorous campaign by both those who wished to officially join with Switzerland and those who wished to return to Italy, a plebiscite was held among the people of Campione.

 SWI_robert_grimm_leader_desc:9 "§YBorn:§! §LApril 16th, 1881, in Wald, Zurich, Swiss Confederation§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to a German Protestant family, Robert Grimm grew up the son of a machine fitter and weaver, which taught him the skills to gain an apprenticeship as a printer. Familiar with industrial machinery, he excelled in the workshops of Oerlikon, the industrial sector of the city of Zurich an embarked on his 'Wanderjahre' (journeyman years) in 1905. This wide trip across Germany, France, Austria and Italy introduced him to radical Marxist ideas. Upon his return he joined the Swiss Social Democratic Party and was subsequently blacklisted due to an attempt to organise his workplace outside of Basel. Bereft of employment, Robert turned to journalism and political activism, leaving Basel-Stadt in favour of Bern, where he participated in the strikes of 1906 and 1912. By the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Robert turned away from the failed optimism of the Second International and towards the ambitions of Bolshevism, spending time in the company of the Russian exile Vladimir Lenin. In the wake of the February Revolution, he helped to negotiate Lenin's return and unsuccessfully sought to utilise his influence among German workers to mediate a separate peace between Russia and Germany. A year later he organised the Olten Action Committee in the eponymous Solothurn town of Olten.\n\nEconomic collapse and a looming famine had necessitated the Swiss Government to decree the conscription of all civilians to aid in public works, which faced nationwide resistance. When his comrades hesitated, Robert effectively hijacked the Social Democratic Party to push for a general strike, in hopes that it would break the back of the Federal Council and establish a Swiss People's Republic. The 1918 Swiss Landesstreik/Grève du Pays (National Strike) was short and brutal, leaving several workers dead and a near military coup shaking the country, as the army intervened to crush the uprising. Robert, who has ever since then been known as the 'Father of the National Strike', faced years in prison but upon his release returned to fighting for workers rights and maintained an immense political influence. In recent years he has drifted between both the moderate and radical wings of the socialist movement, but he has never forgotten his roots and has always been ready for the day that the glorious Swiss revolution, dreamed of in 1918, can truly be made real.§!"

Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the \"Great Scholar\" under the Dalai Lama. He was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the centre of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernising his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no other way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party. He began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag.§!"

Jerusalem, Damascus and Aleppo fell in quick succession, as only the controversial decision by the commander of the Sixth Army to withdraw into the mountains of Anatolia was able to stop the chain reaction. A valiant defeat at Antep and a Pyrrhic victory near Maraş ultimately stopped Allenby in his tracks.\n\nAt that point, the atmosphere of the Empire was rapidly changing, as the Ottoman government realised that even a victory would come at a cost. Furthermore, a change had happened in the palace as well. The İTC puppet Mehmet V had passed away, and in his wake followed the far more assertive Mehmet VI Vahdettin. Unwilling to accept the power of the Committee, Vahdettin began plotting in order to neutralise the Triumvirate. Seeing the collapse of his Empire on all fronts, with the Triumvirate government held responsible for the disaster, and facing increasing pressure outside and within the İTC, Talaat Pasha decided to resign and concede to the Sultan.\n\nThe new Grand Vizier, Ahmed Izzet Pasha, didn't interfere with the last İTC congress, where the party, following Talaat Pasha's advice and seeking to distance itself from the actions during the War, was dissolved, but at the same time re-established under a new name - Teceddüt Fırkası (Renewal Party). The Sultan soon decided he needed a more pliant government, and Ahmed Izzet Pasha was replaced by Ahmet Tefvik Pasha. A month later, further attempts by Vahdettin to put his relative Damat Ferid Pasha in office were thwarted by Teceddüt and OHAF, another İTC splinter, and in backroom negotiations the old Committee leader Ahmet Rıza made his move and was appointed Grand Vizier."

 ottomans_political_events.3.d:9 "Including the controversial Coeducation and Unification Act, the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Representatives) was presented today with a wide variety of reforms and plans for committees by the modernist OHF. As the OHF has a near supermajority in the House after their 1935 electoral success, many remain worried that the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate) may yet prove a sterner obstacle. Its members are almost entirely appointed by the Padishah himself and have maintained a much less modernist and centralist bent amongst its ranks. Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] known for being a devout Muslim and sharing many of the conservative tendencies of the opposition, has mostly kept himself absent from the political process ever since his ascension 10 years ago either because of a general apathy or perhaps as a true believer in his role as a modern ceremonial monarch. With the future of Religious Education through the medreses now on the line however, many expect the Caliph of Islam to finally take a stance against the secularists."
 ottomans_political_events.5.d:9 "Although not entirely unexpected, the Grand Vizier is outraged by this result which he suspects is the result of the Sultan's interference. As the Sultan - strictly speaking - remained within his jurisdiction, only encouraging the senators to vote against the bill, the OHF has not made any mention of legal recourse at this time. Many speculate from this the start of increasing interference by the House of Osman in the daily affairs of Parliament.\n\nGrand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu has been seen earlier today making his way to Dolmabahçe Palace to present his opinion to the Sultan and to ensure that no further 'encouragements' will be conducted in the future. Although not directly threatening the Padishah, the Grand Vizier does not hide his disdain for the outcome of the vote and the Senators that aided in its failure."
 ottomans_political_events.10.d:9 "A known member of the HİF and senator in the Meclis-i Âyân (Senate), Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı was murdered today in broad daylight on the streets of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Attacked by a group of 10 young men, the senator was downed with a gunshot and died instantly.\n\nThe event marks another turning point in the parliamentary crisis as Tefvik was a well known critic of Kemalist policy. Two of the men caught in the attack seem to be affiliated with the OHF party although the latter denies all accountability and has declared that they are being framed by the HİF for an act done by terrorists. Meanwhile the Palace has still not reacted to the crisis, afraid to only further fuel the flames of unrest and to provoke an armed putsch aimed at disabling parliament."
 ottomans_political_events.11.t:9 "Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] Meets With the Grand Vizier Regarding Rising Tensions"
 ottomans_political_events.11.d:9 "With disorder starting to spill out across the streets of Kostantiniye, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has today finally decided to call upon his Grand Vizier.\n\nBeginning with customary deference, the meeting quickly became tense as Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu vigorously made his mind known to the Sultan as to the importance of unified governance without any discordant messages making their way from the Dolmabahçe Palace. He emphasised that interfering with the daily affairs of state is contrary to the system of constitutionalism sworn to be upheld by His Majesty, and in no uncertain language indicated that the Padishah was acting contrary to the interests of his subjects. Just as the meeting crescendos the Grand Vizier sternly requests an immediate new appointment to the Senate in light of Riza Tevfik Bölükbaşı's death to help make right what the clear majority of the electorate are demanding.\n\nSuddenly met with silence, and no longer being lectured by his Vizier, the Sultan contemplates his response."
 ottomans_political_events.11.a:9 "Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] agrees, appointing Şükrü Kaya of the OHF to the Senate."
 ottomans_political_events.11.b:9 "Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] remains silent in the face of his Grand Vizier."
 ottomans_political_events.14.d:9 "Founded in 1908 as an Ottoman newspaper opposed to the rising power of the İTC, the journal has had a shaky relation with Ittihadist movements. When in 1909 the paper published multiple articles from the pen of Hasan Fehmi Bey, the writer and editor-in-chief of the paper was murdered whilst crossing the Galata bridge. Unwilling to bow to the İTC however, the paper continued in opposition to the ruling party and has more recently since the fall of power of the İTC spoken out against the authoritarian tendencies of the OHF.\n\nYesterday evening when the editorial staff had left their headquarters a group of unknown assailants stormed the building shouting the name of the Ghazi Kemal and torched the building to the ground. Gendarmerie were unable to catch the perpetrators who fled the scene before the flames were doused and evidence reports seem to be contradictory."
 ottomans_political_events.16.d:9 "Only a few hours following the departure of Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu, and still reeling from his confrontational meeting with his former Grand Vizier, word came in from the Bostanji (Imperial Bodyguard) that soldiers had appeared outside the palace gates. Afraid that his fate would be the same as that of Abdulhamid II, and seeing with his own eyes troops trickle in just across from the palace, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has preemptively relieved his guard for the night.\n\nA small group of figures emerge from the armed men outside the palace and approach the gates to enter. Under the leadership of the Ottoman Chief of Staff Fevzi Çakmak they subsequently passed through the gates to ensure talks with the Sultan end amicably as troops loyal to the OHF chain of command consolidate their military presence across the city. Fully aware that his opponents wield the upper hand in the streets and military, the old Sultan reluctantly admitted his defeat and has signed an Irade countermanding his dismissal of the Grand Vizier."
 ottomans_political_events.17.d:9 "Although early elections have been written out by Irade of the Sultan, military control over the political institutions has for now not been withdrawn, as generals of the army argue that only through order and military discipline fair elections can occur.\n\nA joint motion of protest from the OİÂMF, HİF and various smaller opposition parties has been submitted however, claiming that the military is biased in favour of the OHF, and that the whole ordeal smells like the \"Election of Clubs\" which completely disabled any opposition to the İTC just before the Weltkrieg."
 ottomans_political_events.18.d:9 "The dismissal of our Grand Vizier and the parliamentary deadlock has led to early elections. Fears of widespread voter fraud and reports of fear tactics in the hinterlands of Anatolia are running rampant as the liberal elite of Kostantiniye are fully aware that another victory for the OHF may usher in a return to the İTC autocracy."
 ottomans_political_events.20.d:9 "Trounced in 1935 by the OHF, the coalition of decentralist and 'liberal' parties has been reshaped under the guidance of the HİF. Although the security of their coalition is far from secure, many are breathing in relief that a return to the İTC autocracy has been averted. Lacking a central policy and with even the leadership looking shaky at best, time will tell however if the coalition will continue to hold their ground."
 ottomans_political_events.21.d:9 "The intelligence apparatus of the state has been in disarray ever since the HİF slashed funding in the 1932 budget reviews to make up for budgetary overspending in the shadow of the Creditanstalt Crisis sweeping through Eastern European economies.\n\nA lack of experienced manpower and funding has gravely maimed its performance and effectiveness in the few years since. To modernise the agency and make it an effective tool to keep our autonomous and more distant provinces in check, the Grand Vizier has ordained its complete dismantlement and replacement by a new entity, the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti (National Security Service).\n\nA range of opposition has cropped up spanning the breadth of expected opposition figures arguing about the fiscal responsibility of such investments to even including several close friends and associates of the Grand Vizier urging him to not take such drastic steps as rumours of building a personalist regime are finding ground even within the party, fearing Kemal is losing patience to work within the confines of the law."
 ottomans_political_events.24.d:9 "As domestic tensions have spilled over into armed violence, seemingly with foreign backing, Parliament convened in a panic to draw up plans of response. With the fissuring of the Empire appearing to be on the line and the OHF rallying behind the Grand Vizier, the energy is inescapable as the popular Grand Vizier commands the respect of even opposition figures in this critical moment.\n\nAs a solution to the escalating crisis it's been deemed politically expedient to grant sweeping executive powers to thoroughly remove all possible armed separatism to the Sublime Porte. This 'Maintenance of Public Order' law passed by the thinnest of margins in parliament earlier today. The Grand Vizier has gained nigh-unlimited power, sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in a state of emergency(as decided by the Grand Vizier). An opportunity has presented itself to the OHF to effectively silence all remaining opposition during this dire hour.\n\nMembers of the HİF haven't been spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connections to the violence, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the party line have already been shut down, the Ministry of the Interior has been thoroughly wiped clean of non-OHF personnel, many officers were temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes ahold of the nation."
 ottomans_political_events.25.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the recent plot on the Grand Viziers life. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former İTC member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the Grand Vizier has reached such levels that a number of his close friends and associates such as Prince Osman Fuad, İsmet Reşit, Ali Fuad Cebesoy and even Chief of Staff Fevzi Çakmak have tried calling the man to reason.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from complicity in the assassination, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more it seems likely that the trials will be solely used as a political play to silence the opposition than to punish those responsible for the plot against the Pasha."
 ottomans_political_events.26.d:9 "Although evidence of complicity is scarce for almost all of those brought before the judge, there remains a certain truth to the charges that many of them harbour sentiments to see the Pasha encounter an early demise either out of opposition to the OHF, abandonment during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg or because of close association with the former İTC. Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with the attempt seems muddy at best."
 ottomans_political_events.27.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Black Band' or Kara Çete, Bald Ali has dragged onto the stage many of the powerful figures still remaining of the İTC and its successor parties, often with close ties to the Liberal Entente. Benefitting from the occasion, however, the Ali has proposed to also target a variety of key members in the HİF leadership whose connection to any sort of plot is hard to prove but who could possibly have accidentally cursed the name of the Pasha in the open. Within the OHF itself however it's becoming increasingly clear that overstepping the boundaries of justice to boost political goals may lead to a split as various more moderate representatives have started to form a clique around the close friend of Kemal, Ali Fuat Cebesoy."
 ottomans_political_events.28.d:9 "Even though the İTC and later the OHF was able to infiltrate all ranks of the Ottoman bureaucracy, many of the higher posts remain inhabited by close associates of the Sultan, HİF appointed candidates or disloyal İTC members who distanced themselves from its successor party. Now that it seems clear that Kemal is steadily marching towards the establishment of a dictatorship with himself at the helm, an opportunity has presented itself to persecute these people and replace them with men loyal to the Pasha. Both a massive undertaking and one sure to risk the ire of both the Sultan and the Ottoman Parliament it may be wiser however to not act rashly here and wait until the party is entrenched in a stronger way."
 ottomans_political_events.29.d:9 "Utilising his new executive powers, the Grand Vizier has earlier today announced a temporary ban on all political parties, bar his own, until the domestic crisis is solved. Pointing out that a wide variety of unscrupulous individuals were able aide and abet militants in their terrorism; the state needs a strong cohesion in these difficult times. The Pasha has ordered the closure of both the HİF and all smaller regionalist parties until further notice.\n\nOpposition to this move has already spread throughout the entire nation as protests in Beirut and Izmir against the tyranny of the Grand Vizier have been called. Newspapers of the capital close up or walk in lock-step with the government, running state approved press to avoid persecution."
 ottomans_political_events.30.d:9 "The Pasha remains unwilling to listen to reason and the megalomania of his plans continues to know no bounds, the moderates of the party under Former Speaker Kazim Karabekir have decided to break off and form an independent party. Calling themselves the 'Democratic Party' to show their aversion to the despotic moves of their former leader, the clique is rapidly growing in size and has left the government paralysed, causing an imminent fall due to lack of a majority in the Ottoman Parliament.\n\nStunned by the sudden reversal of the crisis and relieved that an opportunity has presented itself to firmly halt his Grand Vizier from further fracturing the empire the Sultan has arranged several meetings with leading opposition figures to best figure out a new Grand Vizier for the empire. As Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has already invoked article 35 of the constitution with the Senate, it seems the downfall of the OHF and the centralist project for the empire is upon us."
 ottomans_political_events.31.d:9 "Caused by the fall of the OHF government, the various peoples of the Empire have once more been called to the ballots to decide the future of the Eternal State. Torn apart by an internal divide, the OHF seems primed to suffer a massive defeat as many voters are likely to jump ship over to the new DF. Nonetheless, the HİF has also been polling well as many of the elite fear that the DF is just another wolf in sheep clothes."
 ottomans_political_events.31.a:9 "The HİF secures victory."
 ottomans_political_events.40.d:9 "With the untimely death of our former Grand Vizier and the subsequent power struggle within the OHF, new elections have been written out by Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] to ensure a stable and democratically elected succession. Military interference in its affairs however indicates that without their link through Mustafa Kemal, the army may soon start playing a more direct role in politics and push the nation more on a course they prefer. Either way many fear that these elections are only the beginning and that the situation will remain unstable for the foreseeing future."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.2.d:9 "As the Ottoman Empire joined the Weltkrieg and the İTC consolidated their hold on power even further, so did their plans for a Muslim Turkish which resulted in a series of laws and decrees further promoting a new Turkish bourgeoisie to replace the old Christian one. The explicit focus on promoting the Turkish language and its users however caused a divide between the Arabs and the Turks of the empire that previously did not exist in such shape or form. The Arab language, a proud and even sacred language for the Islamic world, had to concede further power to the Turkish one, to the great anger of the elites across the Mashriq and the Hejaz.\n\nRemaining the sole accepted language for a wide variety of tasks, offices and day to day necessities, other languages were lifted up in status during the tenure of the OİÂMF, in return greatly angering both the Turkish and centralist movements, who saw in it weakness and a grave delay to the westernisation and modernisation of the Ottoman state. With the OHF firmly back in control however, and the Turkish language being adapted to serve a broader public, the Grand Vizier has already announced his intention to re-implement the Turkish language as the sole governmental language accepted in the realm and to change school curricula accordingly."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.4.d:9 "Created as an overarching organisation to protect the Turkish language, much like the Académie Française for the French language, the Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association) has been opened in Kostantiniye today by the Sultan. Serving and combining the efforts of the Turkish Language Committee into one distinct entity, leadership of this new institution was given to Hagop Martayan. From Armenian descent, Secretary-General Hagop served in the Ottoman army during the Weltkrieg where he met Pasha. Leaving the Empire in 1921, he went on to teach Turkish at the university of Sofia before being summoned by Kemal to the language conference held earlier this year in the capital.\n\nCurious to note as well is the negotiations held between the government and the Türk Ocakları (Turkish Hearths), a Turkish nationalist organisation, concerning the institution and possible cooperation between the two to examine the root of the Turkish language and the history of its people. Talks seem to have broken down however as Hamdullah Suphi, president of the organisation, could be seen leaving the Sublime Porte in anger refusing to speak to the press."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.12.d.kemal:9 "Pressured by his government, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has officially announced the creation of the Sublime Committee for Constitution. A vast array of reform proposals have already been submitted to the office of the Grand Vizier who has not yet announced the head of the Committee. Unaware to the public, various internal elements of the party have started to reorganise themselves into two sides.\n\nAli Fuat Cebesoy, close friend and associate of Kemal, has shown disagreement with the harsh party line and mangled opposition. Supported in this by various other members of the Party, they argue against some of the more protectionist elements of Kemal's policy and have shown their discontent with the single party dictatorship he seems to be pursuing.\n\nThey are however opposed in this by the majority of the party who have grown disillusioned with the slow and hindered progress of reforms under the fully democratic system. İsmet Reşit, a rising star within their ranks, has been able to capture the ear of Kemal and has requested the task to be delegated to himself to make sure that the entirety of their joint vision is implemented."

 ottomans_kemalist_events.27.d:9 "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the İTC at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders, such that the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state however came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniye and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HİF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to break of the Kemalist reforms.\n\nConsisting of a wide plethora of orders ranging from the Mevlevi tarikat or \"Whirling Dervishes\" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led them to become kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his hand and his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of his Vizier."

 ottomans_kemalist_events.32.d:9 "Shocked by the terror inflicted on the Laz people in Northern Anatolia, the Kurdish sheikhs and aghas have called a meeting in Diyarbekir to discuss their own future. Whilst firmly loyal to the Caliph, many of them see in the continued augmentation of power within the office of the Grand Vizier and the decreasing influence of the faith on Ottoman society a threat to both the Caliphate as is and their own personal influence.\n\nTherefore the Sheikhs have gathered in the Kurdish city to temporarily settle their differences, and form a united front against the heretic regime in the capital. Messages sent to the Alevi further to the west however have remained unanswered as they have not yet forgotten the vile deeds of the Hamidiye and Sunni Sheikhs only a few years earlier."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.36.d:9 "The Ottoman Bank of Honour, founded during the Weltkrieg by the İTC has steadily become more and more important within the Ottoman Empire and has become its official national bank since. Swept up in the statewide investigation for anti-government elements, an almost astonishing network of corruption, bribery and nepotism was uncovered stretching from deals with the Maronite Church, gifts to various notables to mass land acquisition in Eastern Anatolia. Even though the investigation is still in full sway, more than 300 employees and associates linked to the organisation have already been arrested with many more likely to follow across the Mashriq."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.40.d:9 "Troubling news arose earlier this week as the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti started picking up the trail of a conspiracy against the Sultan and the government in general. Consisting of a radicalised core of former İTC supporters, an anonymous source tipped off the Kostantiniye police warning them of a coming plot to assassinate both the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, assert control over the Porte and crown a new Sultan subservient to their cause. Amongst the conspirators various members of the old İTC Teskilât-i Mahsusa (Special Organisation) of Enver Pasha, many still placed in high positions within the army and security forces. The size of the network is hard to estimate, as bad communication with the Eastern provinces where various groups loyal to Envers former Army of Islam still roam, hindering the gendarmerie's ability to conduct a full investigation."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.44.d:9 "Osman Fuad, Ottoman şehzade and field marshal, was in Şişli discussing the state of the Eastern Army with Mustafa Kemal and Field Marshal Fevzi Çakmak when he received news of the Palace Raid. He went straight to the Royal Stables and took control of the 300-strong Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment - a ceremonial lancer unit formed from Karakeçili Turkmens. In full ceremonial uniform, armed with lance, carbine and cavalry sabres, the household cavalry charged downhill to the Dolmabahçe Palace and crushed the paramilitary rebels positioned outside. Assaulting the palace itself, they chased the rebels through the building, and rescued Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName]. Osman Fuad was reportedly enraged to find the Sultan murdered and swore justice would be done. On his orders, the cavalry regiment was quickly assembled outside the Palace."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.49.d:9 "Having restored order to the capital, Osman Fuad assumed full control of the Ottoman Armed Forces. After graciously allowing Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] to go into retirement in the Yıldız Palace, Osman Fuad son of Mehmed rode to Eyüp Sultan Mosque at head of his Ertuğrul Cavalry. Surrounded by an immense crowd, he entered the mosque alone for the sword ceremony. After brief prayers by clergymen, the ancient Sword of Osman was brought forward. Osman Fuad astonished everyone present by taking the sword and tying it to his belt himself, in defiance of the customs. The ceremony ended with the declaration of the new Padişah to the public. Later that day, the 44-year-old Sultan visited the tombs of his ancestors around the old city in preparation for his sovereign duties as Sultan Osman-ı Rābi'."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.50.d:9 "Comrades in arms during both the Turkish-Italian war and the Weltkrieg, the friendship between Mustafa Kemal Gelibolu and the newly crowned Sultan is no secret, and their friendly appearances side by side in public have further reinforced the close ties the two men are deemed to have. As such it came as no surprise to the Ottoman people that the former Grand Vizier of the late Sultan Abdülmecid II was summoned earlier today to the Palace to discuss the future of the Empire.\n\nAgreeing on a wide selection of topics, the Sultan has requested from Kemal that he fully presents his plans for the future of the State and has bestowed upon him the office of the Grand Vizier once more."

Dismayed as to the outcome of parliament and after years of careful efforts to build a modern nation for all Ottoman citizens to be able to enjoy the fruits of their empire; it unravelled in front of the Vizier that his people spat on his hopes to lift all people of the empire upward.\n\nWithout much in way of recourse and left in a meeting with the Sultan over the passing of this legislation the Grand Vizier of the Sublime Porte sits across from His Royal Majesty in a stern silence."

 ottomans_kemalist_events.61.d:9 "Bearing the seal of the Grand Vizier and an irade decreeing the closure of all anti-patriotic news agencies, police forces and soldiers of the Constantinople Corps could be seen going from door to door confiscating printing presses and sealing offices of newspapers affiliated to the opposition. Liberal protestors gathered in front of the buildings have called upon the soldiers to cease their actions at once, crying out that the freedom of speech and free press are being silenced by the dictatorship of the Grand Vizier.\n\nA small skirmish between police forces and protestors in front of the HİFs main office was broken up by police batons as 10 bystanders were taken into custody for \"unpatriotic actions\" and \"treason towards the Sultan\"."
 ottomans_kemalist_events.66.t:9 "The Abdication of Abdülmecid II"
 ottomans_kemalist_events.66.d:9 "Abdülmecid II was girded with Osman's sword in 1926, after the death of his cousin Mehmed VI Vahdettin. On the day he swore allegiance to the constitution before parliament, he declared that he would rule only as a constitutional monarch, respecting the rule of law and not partaking in political intrigues. Since then, he has held firm in his philosophy of rulership, only deigning to give his opinion to politicians if requested. Years have gone by, and the country once again turned away from the democracy it had once been building. Just as before, the new government decided to concentrate all the levers of power into its own hands, including religion, reducing the Sultan to barely a figurehead. But for many people, he remained an untouchable symbol of the nation.\n\nTime and again, the Grand Vizier found the Sultan increasingly withdrawn when he brought him more decrees to sign. At first, the Caliph argued fiercely with his chief servant, sometimes managing to convince him, then trying to use his right of veto, which often complicated the government's life. Eventually parliament deteriorated into a weapon of the party, the Sultan gradually abandoning his attempts to resist the will of his Vizier, signing all decrees in silence. So great was his surprise when, during his last visit to Dolmabahçe Palace, instead of his pen, His Majesty reached for a sheet of paper, upon which the Grand Vizier found his intention to abdicate.\n\nThe Sultan-Caliph, who at this point wore the face of a greater age than his years, tried to half-heartedly describe his declining health and desire to spend his last years painting. The Grand Vizier maintained a stern look reading the quiet reality of their situation. After a brief conversation, Abdülmecid bid his adieu and departed from the office for the last time."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.6.d:9 "As a solution to the immunity of sitting representatives and to grant the executive powers necessary to thoroughly remove all possible opposition to the establishment of stability, the 'Maintenance of Public Order' law was enforced through imperial decree earlier today. Granting the Marshal nigh-endless authority and completely sidelining parliament for as long the nation remains in crisis (decided by the Marshal), an opportunity has presented itself to Fevzi Çakmak to effectively eradicate all remaining opposition to his designs.\n\nMany desperados, veterans and former members of the İTC have already remained in hiding, for fear of being considered complicit in these ghastly crimes, whilst others have already taken the cowards way out. Kılıç Ali, one of these individuals, has reportedly shot himself after gendarmerie broke down the door of his home, when others such as Kara Kemal fled the capital in a hurry to escape arrest.\n\nMembers of the HİF aren't spared either as a wave of arrests targeting them for possible complicity, even though none of them seem to have any solid connection to the plot, is shaking up the capital. Newspapers not following the new party line are shut down, military training exercises cancelled, officers temporarily put on leave and the residence of the Grand Vizier put under close guard 24/7 as paranoia or, as some see it, political opportunism takes hold of the nation."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.7.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Tribunals of Progress', through the special emergency measures a number of tribunals have been set up in Kostantiniye, Izmir and Bursa to persecute all those possible involved in the “political coup against democracy”. Chaired by Bald Ali, a former lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman army and former İTC member himself, the list of men associated with the conspiracy keeps growing by the day as the megalomania and paranoia of the military establishment has reached new highs.\n\nTried with a combination of charges ranging from trumped-up bribery claims, treason to the state, abandonment of duty and more, it seems likely that the trials will be used more as a political play to silence the opposition rather than to punish those responsible for the disruption of law and order."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.8.d:9 "Although evidence of complicity is scarce for almost all of those brought before the judge, there remains a certain truth to the charges that many of them harbour resentments toward the Marshal and hope to see his early demise either out of opposition to the OHF, their own close association with the former İTC, or fear for their own careers and even lives. Only 7 men on the list however were able to be caught by the Gendarmerie as many others departed the country shortly after the failed attempt, or have gone into hiding in the vast hinterlands of Eastern Anatolia. Unfortunately for the Tribunal, this also means that those who were picked up by the Gendarmerie carry the least guilt and although some links to a backroom meeting almost 5 years ago were found, the content of said meeting and whether or not this could be associated with successive seems muddy at best."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.9.d:9 "Dubbed the 'Black Band' or Kara Çete, Bald Ali has dragged onto the stage many of the powerful figures still remaining of the İTC and its successor parties, often with close ties to the Liberal Entente. Benefitting from the occasion however, Ali has proposed to also target a variety of key members in the HİF leadership whose connection to any sort of plot is hard to prove but who could possibly have accidentally cursed the name of the Marshal in the open. Within the OHF itself however, it's becoming increasingly clear that overstepping the boundaries of justice to boost political goals may lead to a split as various more moderate representatives have started to form a clique around the close friend of Kemal, Ali Fuat Cebesoy."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.10.d:9 "Even though the İTC and later the OHF was able to infiltrate all ranks of the Ottoman bureaucracy, many of the higher posts remain inhabited by close associates of the Sultan, HİF appointed candidates and disloyal İTC members who distanced themselves from its successor party. Now that it seems clear that the Fevzi clique is steadily marching towards the establishment of a dictatorship with themselves at the helm, an opportunity has presented itself to persecute these people and replace them with men loyal to the Marshal. Both a massive undertaking and one sure to risk the ire of both the Sultan and the Ottoman Parliament; with the backing of the Military however, it is unlikely anything can oppose the Marshal's will."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.12.d:9 "Although the remnants of the Liberal Entente have tried their best to rally the troops and spread their propaganda, the decision of our Müşîr to hold elections within two months has made any form of victory by their front nigh impossible. This was further exacerbated by the closing of the ranks within the OHF and the formation of the 'Endeavour Front' between various powerful parties. Furthermore, there was strong support of the Ottoman bureaucracy for the Front as they hoped that with it, the legacy of the İTC could be carried forwards and their plans executed. When the last ballots were counted, it was no surprise that the Front had successfully acquired the landslide it aimed for."
 ottomans_fevzi_events.13.d:9 "Encouraged by our Müşîr, the various political parties have been brought together to create what has rapidly become known as the 'çalışma cephesi' or 'Endeavour Front'. Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified.\n\nAlthough various liberal figures, especially amongst the ranks of the HİF, have denounced the initiative as it would only serve as a cover for continued military guidance, Kâzım Karabekir has openly accepted the offer and has been seen together with Inonu by the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] press. It seems unlikely that they see fully eye to eye on matters of political reform and the dwindling economic power of the Porte but for now these two heavy weights are uniting their forces."
 ottomans_liberal_events.1.d:9 "What some may have seen coming ever since their close victory in 1935 has today become reality: the OHF, party of the Turkish nationalists and İTC remnants, has been thoroughly defeated and their coalition shattered.\n\nNow we must pick up where the Liberal Entente left off in 1934 and repair all that has been torn down. The first matter of the day however is already a very precarious one however as even though the OHF coalition no longer has the majority, we aren't as united of a front as we would have liked to be, and the choice of Grand Vizier is a hotly contested discussion subject amongst the various party leaders. The HİF leaders seem to find themselves in a debate between who among their ranks will be able to implement their programme of full decentralisation and bold initiative to reinvent the Ottoman Empire. Former HİF member Mustafa Sabri, who leads his MMF party, seems determined to support the Liberals once again, although prominent conservative leader Shakib Aslan has remained silent so far. Shakib Arslan from the Mt Lebanon region seems to be his main opponent with a focus on Islamic solidarity, morality and a return to old. The Druze prince, better known as Amir al-Bayan (Prince of Eloquence) has captivated the minds and hearts of many prominent Arab families and seems to have the support of the religious establishment with some even going so far as having an ear within the palace.\n\nAs these two squabble for the position however, many are turning eyes to the DF whose support during the last liberal coalition was instrumental for its success. The relatively young party, founded by ex-general Kâzım Karabekir, nonetheless has seen its election results explode with every election as the promise of a middle way between the hard-line OHF and the Liberal Entente is finding large support amongst the Turkish middle class whilst the generals personal record can count on the support of many former and present soldiers."
 ottomans_liberal_events.2.t:9 "Kâzım Karabekir Congratulates the HİF"
 ottomans_liberal_events.2.d:9 "Serving as Speaker of Parliament with the OHF victory in late 1935 until recently and during the prior OHF government of 1927-1931, former brigadier-general and Great War hero Kâzım Karabekir has begun negotiations with the newly victorious HİF to participate in potential coalition arrangements. His party, the DF (Democratic Party), has exploded onto the scene, seeing a significant share in seats as a new breakaway party and seems to be acquiring a status as something of a rising star within the Empire; many expect that he will make a bid for the position of Grand Vizier as his party makes its presence known among the national political consciousness.\n\nArriving through Haydarpasa station on the Eastern side of the Bosporus, the man was recently spotted being escorted directly to the Dolmabahçe Palace, presumably for an audience with Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName]. With a programme serving as the middle ground between the older and for many aristocratic HİF and the authoritarian OHF, it seems likely that the Sultan will at least seriously consider the man who has in the past already stood close to the palace."
 ottomans_liberal_events.3.d:9 "The Prince of Eloquence finally broke the silence by supporting the coalition around the HİF and was followed by many Arab deputies who did the same. Although the programme of the future government does not fully satisfy Arslan, he nevertheless stated that the most important thing at this time is to prevent the OHF from taking power again. Coalition talks seem to be progressing in a satisfactory fashion as the Liberals seems well underway to form an acceptable coalition to oppose the centralists. With a programme focused on severe decentralisation and with most governing shifted to provincial assemblies, many of the minorities and Arabs are showing their support for his ideas. Nonetheless many conservatives remain opposed as whilst they believe that the programme of the OHF is borderline heresy and a disaster for the Ottoman state, they remain opposed to complete decentralisation as they fear this would have a negative effect on Islam and the position of the Sultan-Caliph."
 ottomans_liberal_events.4.t:9 "Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] Appoints the Next Grand Vizier"
 ottomans_liberal_events.4.d:9 "The heated debate among the newly formed but fragile liberal coalition seems to be finally resolved, and in a rather unexpected way. Seeking an affordable compromise and deciding to accept the proposal of the newly-formed DF both HİF and MMF agreed to offer the post of the Grand Vizier to the well-known liberal sociologist - Prince Sabahaddin. Although the latter is not a member, Sabahaddin and his affiliated Millî Ahrar Fırkası (National Liberty Party) share almost the same ideology as the HİF, which has enough seats to become the backbone of the coalition.\n\nAs decreed by the Ottoman constitution, the final decision remains in the hands of the Sultan-Caliph, and as such many were wondering what was going in-between the palace walls. After thorough discussion with all candidates and a meeting with his advisors, the Sultan has today affirmed the next Grand Vizier as:"
 ottomans_liberal_events.5.d:9 "Disillusioned by the continued cooperation of the DF with the HİF, and fully convinced that the path they have chosen is destined to lead the empire into ruin, a group of Turkish nationalist deputies has announced that they would break their ties with the party and form their own faction. Whilst this comes as a significant blow to the party and may eventually lead to them abandoning the coalition if further signs point this way, the government currently still has a workable coalition."
 ottomans_liberal_events.6.t:9 "Corruption Scandal Rocks the HİF"
 ottomans_liberal_events.6.d:9 "Brought to the parliamentary floor by a group of opposition members, a clear link has been established between the undersecretary of the Grand Vizier and unknown expenses of the Ottoman treasury. Furthermore, they have proof that the man misused his position to empower his friends and family, granting them significant properties from the Defterdarlik (internal revenue office) in the region of Ainteb. This news was further soured by the testimony of Aintebi citizens who pointed out that the properties were seized by the Ottoman state during the Armenian deportations and never returned, even though their original inhabitants safely found their way home against all odds.\n\nThis unfortunate correlation has had significant repercussions on the Armenian delegates of the HİF, who out of protest have announced their immediate departure from the coalition, taking up their places amongst the independents."
 ottomans_liberal_events.7.d:9 "As the deportations of Armenians and Greeks increased during the Weltkrieg and the death count started to ramp up, their possessions were usually left behind and confiscated by local Muslims. To deal with the growing amount of abandoned houses and other properties, these were ultimately placed under the regulations of the Abandoned Properties Laws and made possession of the state until the original owner could return and prove his ownership. During the war however, these properties were used as payment and enticement for local Kurds and other Muslims for their contribution to the war and the deportations in specific.\n\nAs the war came to an end and many of the Armenians deported along the Homs-Hama-Damascus route returned to Cilicia, the new owners of these properties were evidently less interested in returning these. A commission was sent from Kostantiniye to solve the issue and peacefully assist in the restitution of these properties but heavy opposition from the local Muslim residents, boosted by the efforts of local İTC leaders such as Taşçızâ de Abdullah, Kethüdazâde Hüseyin Cemil Göğüş, Mamat Ağazâde Ali Effendi, the Kurd Hacı Osman Agha and Hafız Mehmet Şahin, ultimately forced them to withdraw despite the pleas of the Central Service of Armenian Repatriation. The Armenians in question would ultimately be painted as traitors to the Ottoman Empire, enemies of the state and willing collaborators of the Entente occupation in 1918-1919.\n\nThe Armenian deputies never stopped fighting for restitution however and with their hopes invested in the HİF to finally give them back their land, they have seen in the recent sales of Miri land an opportunity to receive a fair compensation for their losses during the war. Many Muslims deputies however are firmly opposed to these ideas, with members from the OHF often even going as far as saying that this is their reward for the treachery during the war. This has prompted the Armenian deputies to lose their patience with the coalition as their inability to take a decisive stance on the issue has now led to an ultimatum. Either their people are compensated or all Armenians will withdraw from the coalition."
 ottomans_liberal_events.8.d:9 "The recent decision of the government to revise the seized properties of Armenian citizens during the Weltkrieg has caused quite the stir in the city of Ainteb, as protests and riots by the Muslim population of the city against these plans have started to escalate once more. As these properties have by now often passed through many hands and with some even converted to industrial sites, the Turks are fighting tooth and nail to keep the imperial inspectors from restoring them to their original Armenian owners.\n\nThe serious backlash the HİF is receiving from the actions has caused them to reconsider once more as various interest groups in Adana and Ainteb are finding support amongst the OHF for their struggle. The Armenian delegation remains steadfast though and insists on the proper return of their land, still threatening to bail from the coalition if their demands aren't met."
 ottomans_liberal_events.9.d:9 "Although the centralists have been unable to gain the support necessary to form a workable coalition, we on our own don't either. The DF of Kâzım Karabekir holds the key in this impasse as its triumph at the ballots has established the party substantially to the point that they can now position themselves as kingmaker. Kazim is very well aware of his position and has been playing hardball with the HİF in an attempt to secure the position of grand vizier for himself.\n\nWith the mind of the Sultan set on Sabahaddin however, he is now willing to negotiate a coalition. The price is high however as not only the ministries of war and finances would be given to his party but also the ministry of foreign affairs, which would ensure strong influence of his party on nearly all shapes of policy."
 ottomans_liberal_events.13.d:9 "With the government no longer capable to support a workable coalition, the Grand Vizier has handed his resignation to the Sultan 4 weeks ago who accepted this and disbanded the Meclis-i-Mebusân. Now 30 days later, the day of the elections is upon us and it seems as if the Grand Vizier has chosen wisely as an increase across the board for his party was noticeable. Especially in the non-Muslim vilayets of the empire, many seem to have embraced his decentralist ideals and the prospects of self-government through the provincial assemblies. Arabs seem to cautiously support him as well as the Osmanlı İdaresi Âdem-i Merkeziyet Fırkası (Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation) has officially disbanded and transferred all its deputies over to the HİF."
 ottomans_liberal_events.19.d:9 "Although the ideas of the HİF and Prince Sabahaddin in particular were not of sectarian nature, the fears of the OHF seem to be coming true, as the increased participation of the lower classes in Ottoman politics has left the state particularly vulnerable to a steady rise of the Islamist flank. Supported by the powerful Sufi orders such as the Naqshbandi, the clique around Shakib Arslan has seen its power in the Ottoman parliament grow tremendously to great concern of the non-Sunni groups. Whilst the presence of religion in politics is not directly a cause for concern as this was also envisioned by Sabahaddin, various minority groups are fearful that Arslan is going to ride a wave of Sunni populism and dismantle the system we have so painstakingly built up."
 ottomans_liberal_events.20.d:9 "Recent developments in the Chamber of Deputies and amongst the electorate have left the HİF in an especially weak position. Leaning primarily on its coalition partners in the shape of the MMF and the DF, the position of Grand Vizier is coming under fire not just by the opposition but also from within the coalition itself.\n\nRumours have it that the DF is considering a change in government, taking the position of the HİF as leader of the coalition and propelling one of their own figures to the position of Grand Vizier. On the conservative benches, similar ideas are being considered with Arslan more than willing to take the position for himself."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.2.d:9 "After the abolition of the Janissary corps in the early 19th century, a variety of military organisations were established to ensure order and stability in the provinces of Rumelia and Anatolia. With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie).\n\nServing with distinction in Rumelia after the 1908 revolution and on the battlefields in Anatolia during the Weltkrieg, the by then rebranded Umûm Jandarma Kumandanligi (Gendarmerie General Command) had proven its worth and was drastically expanded to the various Arab and Kurdish provinces. One of the issues this brought with it however, and a general complaint from many non-Turkish citizens, was that the gendarmerie (especially in the higher positions) almost solely recruited from Turkish citizens and as such couldn't be counted as a non-discriminatory organisation.\n\nTo solve this issue, the HİF has tabled a proposition to revise recruitment standards and to utilise more Arab manpower in the corps. This has led to protests from Turkish nationalists who see this loosening of standards as a liability and potential threat to the security of the Arab vilayets should revolts escalate."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.18.d:9 "Discontent by the path of the liberal government and concerned by the risks posed by their reforms to the integrity of the Ottoman nation, the 2nd division of the First Army has executed a coup earlier today, arresting the Grand Vizier and his ministers during the morning. In what some call a repeat of the 'Raid on the Sublime Porte' just before the Weltkrieg, the armed forces under the command of Field Marshal Fevzi Çakmak have through this action effectively taken control over the capital. With communication lines cut to the hinterland, many are now wondering what future awaits them. Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has for now not yet taken an official stance concerning the events, preferring to wait the storm out fearful that his own position may be on the line."

A variety of Turkish nationalists parties and deputies, held responsible for the failed coup, have been disbanded and arrested. The position of the HİF, strengthened by the defeat of their opponents on the field of battle, has now never been stronger as many opposed to their programmes are now remaining silent to avoid persecution, arrest and possibly even death."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.25.d:9 "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte.\n\nAs the Kaiser saw in the Porte the ultimate ally to weaponise Islam and point it at his rivals, the Germans focused their efforts in the Ottoman Empire on developing and spreading this ideology in the hopes of bringing it to completion when war with the French broke out once more. Unleashing hordes of angry Muslims (German estimates were talking of hundreds of millions of rebels rising in unison), a circle of Orientalist figures close to the Kaiser saw one key figure in this entire plan: the Sultan-Caliph of the Ottoman Empire. Through German influence in Turkish statecraft and the education of its new elite, centred primarily on the armed forces, the Caliph adopted it as his own and used it himself to rein in disloyal elements.\n\nAfter the fall of Abdulhamid II in the 1908 revolution and with the ascendance of a new regime that wished to pursue a more secular path, the Germans did not give up and as the reality of the situation started to sink in, the İTC ultimately started to openly pursue an Islamic ideology. War arrived on the shores of the Dardanelles in 1915 and the call for Jihad was launched shortly after... to little success. The grand romantic scheme of the Kaiser, in which through his puppet Caliph he would be able to unleash an unstoppable tide on his enemies, bore little fruits. The idea wasn't forgotten however, rather doubled down upon, as through the network set up by Von Oppenheim and his associates various schools, forums and teachers were sent out to all corners of the world to awaken a spirit of resistance and solidarity for the Caliph.\n\nThe largest success story of pan-Islamism can be found amongst the Muslim subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the Weltkrieg that would likely have been greatly reduced without the efforts of various Islamist groups. This has brought with it however a large price, as promoting Muslim solidarity makes it hard to secularise the state and limit the influence of the faith on matters of state. Furthermore, the Islamist rhetoric has spread to Egypt after the end of the war where in the young nation, it found fertile ground to further develop its ideas and if necessary use them against both Sultan and Kaiser."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.27.d:9 "Be it out of sympathy for their brethren in Bursa, similar protests shook Konya and Mosul this week as opposition amongst the Muslims against the Grand Vizier keeps mounting. The Vizier nonetheless has made sure to entertain the people of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with public displays of piety to ward off any nay-sayers and seems to have switched his usual rhetoric up with more references to Islam.\n\nWhilst politicians have always been forced to be careful when it comes to matters of religion, most notably under Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal who was infamous for his less than ideal remarks on the subject, the situation seems to have become even more inflammable due to the events in Jerusalem. Pan-Islamism, the weapon of both Abdulhamid II and the İTC, now seems to be turning itself against the institutions of power instead of protecting them..."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.28.d:9 "Keenly aware of the escalating situation in the office of the Grand Vizier, the Turkish nationalists have embarked on a full offensive against the HİF and its leader. Blaming them for the economic recession, insinuating that his horse is more pious than himself and openly questioning the policies of the Grand Vizier, the speeches and pamphlets have been eagerly diffused by the various newspapers and media outlets associated with the old OHF.\n\nWhilst the inherent hypocrisy of these remarks - coming from a wing of parliament which has done nothing but advocate for secularisation these last few years - is striking, their words are greatly damaging the reputation of the Vizier whose position within the coalition is becoming more fragile by the day."
 ottomans_sabahaddin_events.29.d:9 "A group of conservative deputies, primarily from Anatolia, have announced a full withdrawal of their support for the Grand Vizier earlier today and are demanding his immediate replacement if the coalition is to survive. Their declaration has been met with renewed trust from various Christian and other non-Muslim deputies, only further throwing oil on the fire that has by now completely overtaken the party.\n\nSultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has in response called the Grand Vizier for an audience to discuss the situation which has by many been interpreted as a signal that royal support for the Prince may be faltering. Newspapers published by nationalists and Kemalist veterans are eating their heart out as the drama continues to grow. An attempt by the Grand Vizier to shut down some of these papers was met with opposition from the other side of the floor, with many of the coalition partners objecting to this proposed press censorship."

 ottomans_arslan_events.4.d:9 "As the Ottoman Empire decayed during the 18th and 19th Century, many of our places of worship withered away. From the Holy Sites in Jerusalem to the tomb of the great Saladdin or the mosque of Diyarbekir, spending has primarily gone to the military and the construction of Western infrastructure and the purchase of Western goods. Furthermore, the previous governments have held strongly to the idea that deficit spending should be prevented at all cost and have shown that they would rather protect their own interests than fulfil their duty towards our heritage and the legacy of Islam.\n\nDrafted up by the Arslan cabinet, an ambitious plan has been unfolded today with the support of the Caliph to pump resources into a 'rejuvenation' programme to show that the light of Islam hasn't faded and to show the people that it still governs according to the Laws of the Prophet."
 ottomans_arslan_events.6.d:9 "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all Muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensure order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself. Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the İTC regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses and write out the call for Jihad whilst his position on the Imperial Cabinet was taken away and control by the Young Turks over the religious hierarchy sharpened.\n\nMany conservative forces saw these actions as an insult against both the office and the importance of Islam in Ottoman society. Further reductions in power of the office of the Caliph itself further encountered disappointement, anger and frustration as they saw these deeds not as positive for the overall administration of the Empire but an attempt to sacrifice tradition and authenticity for cheap imitation of the West. Many in the Islamist movement, whereunder Arslan himself furthermore believe that religion does still play an important role in Western society and that it is just because of their shared Christian beliefs and their dedication to them that they have been able to outclass the Muslims. They believe that the attempts by the West to impose their set of rules on our society are done out of religious reasons and that their sole goal is the ultimate victory of the Cross over the Crescent.\n\nThe cabinet, inspired by Western governmental forms and occupied by those educated along Western standards and knowledge is thus in dire need of spiritual guidance and a system of checks and balances to ensure they can not abolish what is sacred. As the Caliph, for now, is barred by the constitution from directly intervening, the Şeyhülislam works without this framework and should thus be restored to his original pre-İTC position. Church and State should not be separate as it is their unison that has led to our greatest victories and our renouncement of Islamic values that has led to our demise. No more!"
 ottomans_arslan_events.7.d:9 "When the Ottoman constitution first went into effect in 1876 as the summum of the Tanzimat reforms, it for the first time in Ottoman history tried to ground the power of the Sultan. Nonetheless the constitution did not account for Sultan Abdulhamid II who after just 2 years used the executive powers he still had according to the document to prorogue parliament and greatly hinder the rights and duties granted by it. In 1908 when the Young Turk revolution was able to dislodge the tyrant from his throne, it was restored in full but this new group of reformers had learned their lesson. The great powers of the Sultan were toned down greatly, his status reduced to that of a constitutional monarch and a parliament formed that would take over almost all forms of government.\n\nThe İTC however soon came to realise that in the great diversity and political chaos of the empire, a strong central figure with tremendous power could be useful to shut down possible opposition. By employing a weak and unambitious monarch for their goals, they reasoned that they would have the executive power of an absolute monarch whilst being able to do as they saw fit. Slowly returning power to the position of the Sultan, their plan worked marvellously for Sultan Mehmet V who was smart enough not to oppose the real ruling figures. They had however not accounted for Mehmed's successor, Vahdettin, who with these powers was able to rid himself of the İTC grasp and rule as he saw fit with his allies in the liberal coalition.\n\nThe death of Sultan Vahdettin in 1926 and his succession by the more timid Abdülmecid II allowed much of this power to be shackled once more to a parliamentary body but still allowed him the freedom to appoint a Grand Vizier, declare war and serve as the supreme commander of the Ottoman army. The ageing Sultan never saw much reason to use these powers, very well aware of the threat the military establishment poses to his own position if he should but [OTT_GetHeirName], heir to the throne, seems to have inherited less of his wisdom and has shown interest in the designs by the conservatives to continually shift power back to the office of the Caliph.\n\nAs Parliament continues to prove an issue in this regard, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight."

Frequently used by Abdulhamid II to rid himself of parliamentary interference, this is a worrying step as it is the first clear sign that the Caliph will attempt to take back power in his own hands with the assistance of his Islamist and Royalist support base. Others are however saying that this is an unnecessary worry and that the Sultan has solely taken this decision to better prepare for the elections later this year. Recent changes of leadership within the liberal coalition and the growing foreign threat do give some reasoning for this move but the decision to limit military training exercises and the decision to send some pronounced opposition members to positions abroad does little to hide the true intentions of the Caliph."
 ottomans_arslan_events.9.d:9 "Within the leadership of our grand army, many have been educated by German or French tutors and have as such inherited some of their modern Western values and ideas on a stable society. This brings with it however also the absurd idea that traditions are just there to be discarded, behaviour we will no longer tolerate. This treachery to the Caliph runs deep in the military establishment though and we will have to revise the entire structure from the ground up to ensure that they can no longer prove a threat to the position of the monarchy.\n\nTo block possible opposition from the existing cadre, training exercises have been halted and many of those with ties to the old İTC of the more recent OHF have either been sent abroad or placed under strict scrutiny from our agents. Not all of them seem to be folding as easily though as reports of former İTC members fleeing the capital in the midst of the night have started to trickle in."
 ottomans_arslan_events.10.d:9 "Originating from the era of the constitutional revolution and expanding massively during the Weltkrieg, Anatolia has seen a growing emancipation movement that demanded changes to the old strict rules of the Sharia enforced laws and greater personal freedom. Under the rule of Vahdettin during the '20s, some of their demands were met as education for females was expanded drastically and more professions were opened up to them. Although not going as far as the OHF would have liked, with universal suffrage and the ability for women to enter politics, these reforms by the Caliph of all people were seen with horror by many conservatives who saw in this nothing but an attack on the values of Islam.\n\nWith power now, be it temporarily, shifted towards the Caliph and with Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] a lot more amenable to meeting the demands of his conservative support base, the time has come to reverse these policies and ensure that the values professed by the Holy Book are back in place. Furthermore, the decadent media outlets that allow these women to express their opposition to the faith, should be shut down immediately to avoid their message from infecting even more true Muslims."
 ottomans_arslan_events.11.d:9 "[TUR_arslan_coup_fevzi_status], the army has today stormed Dolmabahçe Palace and the Sublime Porte to retake control over the government. Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has been put under house arrest as the cabinet of Arslan and many Islamist figures were immediately transferred to an undisclosed military prison where they are sure to be met by a military tribunal.\n\nChaos is taking hold across the vast empire as another regime change, so close to the last one is making every last semblance of political stability in the Porte seem removed. With all media brought under direct control of the military establishment now and several orders to arrest highly placed military officers to remove the possibility of the Islamists to regain control, it seems that the junta led by Fevzi Çakmak himself is here to stay."

 ottomans_arslan_events.12.d:9 "Suffering from a stroke after visiting an orphanage near Bursa, the old Sultan was rushed off to Kostantiniye for medical assistance. By the time he arrived however, the damage was already done and the wise Caliph had taken his last breath.\n\nA standing symbol of the democratic rule in the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan was one of the last obstacles left for the Pan-Islamist ambition to restore the full power of the Caliph. Although many point out that this was solely because he knew from experience how the army would react to such an authoritarian move, he nonetheless kept extremism at bay with his hands-off approach to governing.\n\n[OTT_GetHeirName], a younger and less steadfast man, will take over for him and continue to steer the Porte through these turbulent times."

 ottomans_news_events.4.d.kemal_dead:9 "With Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal assassinated in Erzurum, [OTT.GetNameDef] was forced to call emergency elections to fill the leadership vacuum - which have now seen the liberal coalition, defeated earlier in 1935 by Kemal's OHF, gain an absolute majority and thus cement their power.\n\nFollowing his electoral victory, Prince Sabahaddin, the leader of the HİF, was appointed Grand Vizier earlier today by the Caliph, promising to fulfil his agenda of decentralisation and promoting private initiative."
 ottomans_news_events.4.d.kemal_out:9 "Seemingly unable to execute his plans despite the electoral victory in 1935, former Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal submitted his resignation to the Ottoman Caliph only a few months ago. Boldly pushing through his progressive agenda against some more liberally minded OHF members, it seems the former general miscalculated gravely as his party suddenly split beneath him. The liberal coalition, defeated in 1935, has only cemented its power and looks likely to arrange a workable governing majority in this sudden turnaround.\n\nFollowing his electoral victory, Prince Sabahaddin (leader of the HİF) was appointed earlier today by the Caliph, promising to fulfil his agenda of decentralisation and promoting private initiative."
 ottomans_economy_events.1.d:9 "When the dust settled in 1920 and there finally came an end to almost a decade of non-stop war, the economy of the Ottoman Empire lay in tatters. The manufacturing economy which had seen a slow but steady growth in the İTC-era was knocked down as the effects of the Armenian Massacres took their toll on the educated middle class. Doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc. all became critical jobs as a continued exodus by Greek-Ottoman citizens in Asia Minor showed how devastating the 'National Economy' plan was to the ravaged nation. In a similar way, the agricultural sector was ruined as the real effects of the war started to sink in. The loss of the Anatolian Turkish population was mind-boggling as almost 25% of the pre-war population was gone, leaving behind an abundance of land without the manpower to work it.\n\nNonetheless, the Sublime Porte did not sit idle and plans for a swift recovery were quickly drafted, as the first post-war cabinet made it their number one priority. Railroads, left behind by investors of nations no longer existing, were nationalised. The dreaded OPDA was completely shut down and its monopolies transferred over to the state. The 'National Economy' programme became the number 1 priority of the Ottoman government as the horrors of the war, and reliance on an untrustworthy non-Turkish population, left deep scars amongst the ruling elite. A Muslim bourgeoisie had to be groomed to challenge the traditional Christian dominance, the people educated and the empire finally launched into the 20th Century."
 ottomans_separatist_events.38.d:9 "Steadily for some time now the centralising efforts of the ruling party have gone fairly smoothly after the first initial months of touch and go debate in Parliament. Things have once more grown tense over the controversial decision of the Grand Vizier to delay the pronouncement of a new Sharif of Mecca in the scion of Ali Haidar, Abdul Majid Haidar. On Abdul's part there's only the faintest interest in the position as he prefers the city life of the capital, but far more pronouncedly the Chamber of Deputies has recently approved plans to abolish this ancient religious position for so called means of efficiency in governance.\n\nUnimpressed by this newest attack on the Islamic character of his empire, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] has refused to sign the Irade over the last few days. Troublingly, this means the Sultan is now on the precipice of publicly opposing his own government and potentially causing a new round of resistance from various forces in the bureaucracy still opposed to efforts to make such necessary sweeping changes. Worse yet while much of the media has tended to support the government's efforts as of late, if news gets out of such stern resistance from the Sultan it could cause the public to finally unify over a single clear policy that many faithful muslims could find common ground upon to oppose the state with."
 ottomans_flavour_events.1.d:9 "In 1459, Mehmed the Conqueror ordered the construction of Topkapı Palace, the former imperial residence of the House of Osman. As the centuries dragged on however, the sultans and their households preferred their other residences on the Asian side of the Bosporus leading to the Court moving over to the Dolmabahçe Palace. Nonetheless retaining some of its former functions, such as the Imperial Treasury, the Palace was finally emptied in 1927 after the death of Mehmet VI the year earlier. Sultan Abdülmecid II, a patron of the arts and famous artist himself, subsequently granted the grounds to the Ottoman state for use as a museum and art exposition. Closed for almost 8 years, the buildings were thoroughly renovated and restored in an attempt to once more show the splendour of the Ottoman Empire and hopefully rekindle the old Ottomanist spirit.\n\nOpened with a splendid party in the Enderûn, the old Sultan himself presented a multitude of his own works and various masterpieces of contemporary Ottoman art to the gathered world press."
 ottomans_flavour_events.21.d:9 "Sad news befalls us this day, as our beloved Sultan Abdülmecid II has suffered a heart attack and passed on from this world.\n\nFunerals arrangements are already being organised, and naturally shall befit his stature as our Padishah, and as Caliph of all Islam.\n\nAs the news spreads, the streets are filled with the sound of anguish, for the Kayser-i Rûm was seen as a cherished figure for the people, and a fitting figurehead to lead our Empire.\n\nAbdülmecid ibn Abdülaziz was born in 1868 as the heir apparent of the Empire, but only inherited in 1926 following the death of his cousin, as his own father had previously been murdered and ousted from the throne. This late inheritance did not rest easy with him, for as a renowned patron and appreciator of culture, our Sultan sooner devoted his time to painting, music and worship, than to the mundanity of governance.\n\nNevertheless, despite his disinterest in the position, he grew into the role and presided over an era of great change in the Empire.\n\nConservatives will remember him for his piety, while liberals will recognise his willingness to leave the ruling of the Empire to the elected government.\n\nHe is now succeeded by his cousin [OTT_GetHeirName], who will lead the mourning for his predecessor through the capital, before guiding the Empire into a bright new age of his own making, inshallah."

 ottomans_flavour_events.24.d.sultan:9 "The nation mourns, for the House of Osman has lost its most admired member: Mehmed VII, more commonly known as Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName], has suffered a fatal stroke. Though he was nearly 70 years old, his death still leaves the nation in shock, as many were hoping to see his reign last as long as that of his predecessor.\n\nStanding out amongst the royalty for his flamboyant sense of fashion, he had also been a friend of the lower classes. Always ready to spend a dime or two out of his own pocket, even while still a prince, he helped finance weddings and burials and provided clothing and food for the less fortunate, particularly in the Kadıköy district of Kostantiniye. It goes without saying that he was very popular among the common folk, with his popularity only rising during his reign. As the death of such a caring and unifying figure has filled the hearts of the Empire with grief, it is expected that his funeral, which is still in the process of being organised, will see the streets of [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] filled with mourners of all social standings, ready to wish their beloved Sultan a final farewell.\n\nWith the Sultan's passing, Şehzade Mehmed Abdülkadir, son of Abdülhamid II and eldest living member of the Ottoman dynasty, is soon to be crowned Mehmed VIII, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of all Islam. A well-educated man with a special interest in music, he is nearing the same age as his deceased cousin and strikes many as rather apolitical. Whilst his reign will soon enough tell if this assumption is true, he takes the helm of the nation in a time of unprecedented change and tension, both within and without the Empire. We can but hope that he will master these hardships and guide our people into a new age of prosperity!"

Although he was by now almost 70 years old, news of his death still hit the Empire unexpectedly, as many were expecting, even hoping, for him to become their next Sultan, seeing as he was the eldest living member of the Ottoman dynasty and, as such, heir apparent to the Imperial throne.\n\nStanding out amongst the royalty for his flamboyant sense of fashion, he had also been a friend of the lower classes.

Only time will tell if his fate will be more fortunate than that of Mehmed Ziyaeddin and if the realm will see him ascend to the throne of the Empire, fulfilling the destiny that his cousin was denied."

 ottomans_flavour_events.25.d.sultan.main:9 "Once more, tragedy has struck the nation, as [ROOT.GetLeader], beloved father and esteemed Sultan-Caliph, has suffered a fatal heart attack this morning. Nearing his seventies, he spent the last years of his life devoted to the role of Sultan of the Empire despite his worsening health, showing a commitment that is respected by most.\n\nWith the preparations for a grand funeral worthy of a Sultan underway, the nation has now entered a state of mourning, with politicians from all sides of the political spectrum expressing their gratitude for his leadership. Though comparatively short-lived, his reign saw the Ottoman Empire undergo wide-reaching reforms, and whilst he rarely chose to directly influence the politics of the Empire himself, he had always been a unifying figure, holding the realm together in these trying times. Similar in nature to Abdülmecid II, who was known for his love of the arts, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] devoted much of his life to music, growing interested in culture rather than politics and nonetheless managing to become loved by the people."
 ottomans_flavour_events.25.d.sehzade.main:9 "Once more, tragedy has struck the nation, as Şehzade Mehmed Abdülkadir, Vali Ahad of the Empire, has suffered a fatal heart attack this morning.\n\nThe son, and source of many headaches, of Abdülhamid II, Mehmed Abdülkadir could perhaps best be described as eccentric, even rebellious in his younger years, although his advanced age has slowly silenced the non-conformist within him. Never expressing much interest in the politics of the state, he instead dedicated much of his life to the world of music and culture, and even when he became heir apparent to the throne, he seemed to worry little about his potential future as Sultan-Caliph. Throughout the Empire's political scene, many were thus betting on him becoming a Sultan akin to Abdülmecid II, more concerned with the pursuit of his own creative interests than the burden of leadership - but now, these speculations have become irrelevant."

A kind and quiet soul, he is expected to follow the way of his predecessors, embracing his role as a symbol and figurehead whilst refraining from interfering in the country's political matters. Though some fear that Ahmed IV's reign will be short-lived, for his health is allegedly in decline already, for now these doubts have been swept away by the euphoria surrounding his upcoming coronation."

 ottomans_flavour_events.26.d:9 "Sultan Abdülmecid II, whose official short title is Sultan Abdülmecid II Han Hazretleri, is the head of the Ottoman dynasty. As the current Halife-i Müslimîn, he holds unquestioned authority over its more than 150 members, as well as any Muslim. A man of culture and art, Abdülmecid takes his duties as patriarch of a large family very seriously and often acts as an arbiter in crises between relatives.\n\nAll male princes of the dynasty are given the title Şehzade Sultan or Şehzade from birth, while princesses are given the title Sultana or Sultan. The crown prince, who is likely to succeed the current Sultan upon his death, has the title Vali Ahad. Since the 17th century, the Empire has adopted the principle of agnatic seniority, whereby the throne is inherited by the eldest male member of the dynasty. Therefore, it is practically impossible for the son of the previous Sultan to immediately become the new Sultan, bypassing his more senior relatives. Currently, this honour belongs to Abdülmecid II's first cousin, the eldest son of Abdülhamid II, Şehzade Mehmed Selim. However, given his recent poor health, few believe he will outlive our robust Caliph in both body and spirit.\n\nAbdülmecid has four consorts, each having the title 'Kadın', meaning 'official wife of the ruling Sultan'. Their names, in order of seniority, are Şehsuvar, Hayrünissa, Mehisti Hanım and Behrus. The courtiers admire their beauty, and paintings of them by the Caliph himself have received significant praise at foreign exhibitions.\n\nAll of the Caliph's loyal subjects hope that the Sultan will enjoy good health for many more years and that his empire will enjoy only peace and prosperity."

Enjoying private education in the Prince's School of Yıldız Palace, he learnt to speak multiple languages and to play a variety of instruments, including the piano and the violin, which soon became one of his greatest passions. For his military education, he was sent to the German Empire. Climbing up the ladder, he was eventually promoted to the rank of brigadier and received multiple military honours throughout his career.\n\nOne of Mehmed's most notable traits is his rebellious and noncompliant attitude, which more than once led to him and his father butting heads with one another. Refusing the first marriage arranged for him, hiring non-Muslim servants as more than just concubines, and even purposefully wearing his fez in unconvential ways to spite his father, he has always been a man of his own free will - and a cause of headaches for the Sultan.\n\nHe is, however, also a generous and kind soul at heart, described as polite and always ready to support those in need of assistance. Searching for true love for most his life, Mehmed married a multitude of consorts but divorced many of them after just a few years. Going so far as to marry without the permission of the Sultan or the parliament, he was punished by Mehmed V with six months of house arrest and the halving of his allowance. Still, he continued to live the life of a royal within the palaces of Kostantiniye.\n\nAnd now, the man once described as a \"rascal\" has risen to the top, becoming the embodiment of the great Ottoman Empire and of all Islam. Less traditional in mind than most of his predecessors, he is seen as a symbol of the change that has taken hold of the Empire, a herald of the future that lies ahead.§!"

In his youth, he was enrolled at the Military College and rose to the rank of brigadier in the cavalry regiment, but this field was always foreign to him.\n\nMost people who know Ahmed personally note his incredible kindness and sensitivity, two traits which have often gotten him into trouble. Marrying only once and against his father's will, he broke with the old custom of marrying palace women by proposing to Fahriye Hanım, a woman he met during a visit to one of Kostantiniye's girls' schools. Though she has since passed away, their marriage was a happy one, and Abdülhamid even awarded his daughter-in-law a gold medal for caring for her husband in 1905.\n\nThat same year, an unknown person threw a package into the Sultan's car, and Ahmed Nuri, who was accompanying him, quickly jumped out of the car with it, thinking the package was a bomb and that he had just saved his father's life at the cost of his own. However, it turned out to be no bomb but an orphaned child, and his rough landing caused Nuri to develop a hernia, from which he suffers to this day.\n\nAnd now, this quiet and rather inconspicuous prince has risen to the top of the Ottoman Empire as Sultan Ahmed IV, Caliph of all Islam. Given his advanced age, it is questionable whether he will have the time and ability to become a great ruler, but his well-meaning and caring nature is doubted by none - and especially attested by his personal friends, many of whom have received handmade soap from him as a token of their friendship.§!"

 turkey_events.1.t:9 "The Abdication of [ROOT.GetLeader]"
 turkey_events.1.d:9 "The debacle of the Empire has come to an end. The storm has finished blowing and the dust has settled. The Ottoman Empire reveals itself as a victim of the unjust treaty imposed by the Cairo Pact, which saw the end of the century-long Ottoman hegemony in the Middle East. The people that had fled during the war and in its aftermath have now settled by the thousands in Anatolia, famines and massacres were numerous during their flight. The Turkish troops are disorganised, and many soldiers, especially of Arab origin, have already deserted, hoping to find a more glorious future elsewhere, and the world has lost all respect for our nation. These are dark times for the Empire. Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] watches this spectacle from his window, horrified.\n\nThe government of the day no longer shows its face, it knows what it is getting into. The people are grumbling, who are these politicians that led the Empire to its ruin in the belief that they are reforming it? One gets the impression that external affairs have been disregarded in favour of political conflicts of interest. Everyone is waiting for the event that will mark a turning point in this disarray. Since the Sultan-Caliph appears to be the only one with power in this decisive moment, many refer to him. Finally, Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName] announced to his aide-de-camp that he is going to abdicate. He had seen the glory days of the Empire after the Great War, but had been unable to leave the puppet function that had been imposed on his predecessors.\n\n[OTT_GetHeirName] has been proclaimed Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He followed the usual ceremony and was elected Caliph of all of Islam by the Meclis-i Mebûsan. He has been enthroned as 'Khalifa of the Muslims and Custodian of the Holy Places' and now wears the historical mantle - to the disliking of many deputies."
 turkey_osp_events.1.d:9 "This evening at around 10:30 p.m., two armies surrounded [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The first blockaded the main roads leading into the city, whilst the second went straight ahead into the narrow streets of our capital. The OHF government, having been warned of their fate, gathered in the Council of Ministers room and ordered the remaining loyal guards to surrender without resistance. General Refet Bele, accompanied by soldiers, burst into the room and announced their arrest for treason against the Empire and democracy. After locking up the members of the OHF, a group of banned opposition politicians moved into the council chamber. Among them were Kâzım Karabekir, the leader of the former Democratic Party, Sabahaddin Beyoğlu, the progressive prince, and finally Mustafa Sabri, the Shaykh al-Islam.\n\nThis opposition group accused the OHF of having sought to destroy the Empire and to transform it into an anti-Islamist, pro-union republic. The OHF has further been accused of neglecting the army and external threats, which it was supposed to protect from. With most major OHF politicians being put behind bars, the next step of the opposition members was to create a new party, the Ottoman Salvation Party or OSF. Thereafter they declared the state of emergency, for they knew that half the nation was still under OHF control and would have to be taken back from the hands of these traitors.\n\nHowever, before getting started on fighting the remaining influence of the OHF, the members of the OSF first had to decide on the fate of the Sultan. After some discussion, it was decided that he should be forced to abdicate because of his ties to the former government and his unwillingness to take action against those who betrayed the Empire and its people. With both the city and his palace being under complete control of soldiers loyal to the OSF, [TUR.GetLeader] had no choice but to accept this fate. For now, it was decided that our Empire should be ruled by a provisional government with Refet Bele serving as the head of state. However, he cannot truly take the place of a Sultan, and thus a replacement for [TUR.GetLeader] will soon have to be found."
 turkey_osp_events.2.d:9 "The members of the OHF who managed to flee the capital, including many generals, sought refuge in other cities and went into hiding to organise the party's resistance. They called on the troops to rebel and the people to restore the Sultan as the legitimate Caliph. However, this appeal to the people went relatively unheeded, for they still feel betrayed by the OHF and believe that the Sultan failed to prevent such crisis. Nevertheless, many localities and institutions, mainly in the large cities, announced their support for the democratically elected party and rejected what many call the Evening Coup.\n\nAfter the initial euphoria following the success of the coup, the new government realised that its task was not going to be easy. The OHF has left its mark on the institutions and has already established many reforms that seem difficult to reverse. It will certainly be quite the endeavour to go back on very progressive and liberal reforms and fight the OHF presence in local administrations at the same time. Furthermore, many are still questioning the righteousness of the OSF rule, seeing as [TUR.GetLeader]'s reign has not yet been approved by an Ottoman Sultan, another issue which will have to be addressed in the future if the Empire is to withstand the sands of time."
 turkey_osp_events.3.d:9 "As if the resistance of the OHF was not enough, the coalition has now found itself in complete political solitude. Most of the democratic figures have gone into hiding for fear of the OHF and do not dare to resurface, the people are far too preoccupied with the national crisis to be interested in politics, and the few members of the different parties of the governing coalition cannot agree on how to proceed.\n\nAlthough the OSF government currently has next to no support among the populace, our leaders are confident of the way forward. By eliminating the OHF, they plan to avoid any subversive influence, and by reversing their reforms they want to curry favour with the parties that opposed them. Finally, by solving the economic crisis, the party and the coalition can secure the trust of the people, and thus stabilise the position of the provisional government."
 turkey_osp_events.4.d:9 "Most of the generals who were calling for a revolt against the government were spotted and arrested by our agents, and are now languishing in prison awaiting trial. However, the arrest of Fahrettin Türkkan, and the key group of OHF supporters in the army, is causing the armed forces to rumble. For big trouble, Fevzi Çakmak managed to elude us and his current location is unknown. Many soldiers have deserted and the army is now involved in political scandals. If we do not intervene quickly, the situation could very well degenerate and endanger not only the position of the OSF and [TUR.GetLeader], but also the entire nation."
 turkey_osp_events.5.d:9 "The pre-OHF parties have once again been allowed to meet freely and express their opinions in their respective newspapers, the Millet System has been reestablished, and the most radical changes introduced by the OHF, most notably the separation of Church and State, have been reverted. All of this happened with the blessing of the Shaykh al-Islam, which is why most of the influential minorities of the Empire and also the conservatives now support the new government.\n\nNobody can dispute that the OSF coalition is a real political success. Numerous parties have decided to become a part of the coalition, and Refet Bele is generally considered to be the saviour of democracy and religious justice in our nation. Although our people still wish for the return of a Sultan and are thus not entirely content with the current situation, the future seems to once again shine bright for an Empire that until recently was on the brink of collapse."
 turkey_osp_events.7.d:9 "It is time for the elections of the assembly chaired by the OSF coalition. Despite the multitude of political currents and parties, the coalition only consists of two wings, the liberals and the conservatives.\n\nThe progressive liberals are a kind of mix between the DF (Democratic Party), the HİF (Liberal Entente) and some nationalist and progressive movements not far from the OHF and the İTC but disgusted by their authoritarian ways. They are mainly led by Kâzım Karabekir, who was granted leadership of the party in exchange for allowing Prince Sabahaddin the free implementation of his progressive reforms, that were inspired by his stay in France, with the help of a committee.\n\nTheir opponent is the conservative wing of the OSF. The conservatives are mainly democrats who no longer want anti-religious reforms and instead aim to strengthen the relations of the government with the Sultan Caliph. They rejected the practices of Shakib Arslan's Mohammedan Union and found themselves led by the Shaykh al-Islam himself, Mustafa Sabri. Sabri is a Muslim scholar, who believes that Islam is still the religion of science, just like it has been in earlier centuries, during which Eastern scholars made up the forefront of technological advances. He is also the leader of the Teali-i Islam Cemiyeti (Society for the Elevation of Islam).\n\nSince both wings of the party seem to be pretty popular among the people, one could only speculate who would be able to win the election. However, as the day came to an end, a clear victor emerged."

After they did not heed his calls to lay down their weapons, the Pasha gathered soldiers still loyal to the government and began to advance against the rebels.

 turkey_osp_events.20.a:9 "We have to protect the OSF!"
 turkey_osp_events.27.d:9 "Prince Ömer Faruk has alway been admired by the people for the bravery he demonstrated during the Weltkrieg and the Levant Crisis. Furthermore, he has been a close friend and associate of Refet Bele for quite some time now, and it is no secret that his political views mostly align with those of the OSF. For most of the country, it seemed almost certain that if someone was to be proclaimed Sultan by the provisional government, he would be the one chosen. Still, Refet first wanted to stabilise the nation, and felt that he needed full control of the executive powers usually reserved for our Sultans in order to reach this goal.\n\nNow, however, with life in the country slowly returning to normal and the influence of the OHF at an all-time low, it was decided that the time for a Sultan to return to the throne of the Empire had come. As anticipated, the government approached Ömer, who didn't hesitate to accept their offer. His coronation ceremony was held in Dolmabahçe Palace not too long thereafter. As per Ottoman tradition, the ceremony started with Ömer saying a prayer in front of the holy relics of the Empire, followed by him taking his place on the throne and some of the most important OSF politicians congratulating him and kissing his robes. After the Shaykh-al-Islam said a final prayer, Ömer and the leaders of the provisional government rode to the Eyüp Sultan Mosque, where, after another short prayer, Ömer underwent the sword ceremony, during which he symbolically buckled on the sword of Osman I. With the end of the ceremony, Ömer had officially become Ömer I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Caliph of Islam. Throughout the country, our people are celebrating, for their nation is now no longer without a proper leader."
 turkey_osp_events.29.d:9 "It has been five months since the divorce of Ömer and Sabiha, and since then, things have gone relatively quiet, with barely any news about the Sultan's private life escaping the palace. A few weeks back, however, the Sultan came forward to his nation and announced his upcoming wedding with his cousin Mihrişah Sultan, daughter of Yusuf Izzettin Efendi. Though this is rather unusual behaviour for a Sultan, most of our citizen welcomed this news, embraced it as another sign of the Sultan's modernity, and were quickly caught up in the general wave of excitement about the upcoming wedding.\n\nAfter weeks of extensive preparations and planning, today the time had finally come. The ceremony itself was held in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but kept relatively brief, with Ömer and Mihrişah each saying their vows before the Shaykh al-Islam, whom the Sultan personally asked to lead the ceremony, in the early morning hours after a short sermon. Once the formalities were behind them, the couple led a procession through the city, much to the joy of the common folk, who met the royal family with thunderous applause and countless cheers. The procession ended at the royal palace, where a lavish feast was organised for the Sultan's relatives and some high-ranking party officials, with festivities being expected to last for another few days.\n\nThe leadership of the OSF has furthermore made sure to use this opportunity to the fullest to drum up popular support for the monarchy and the party, and has spent the last few weeks organising festivities in most major cities, which have now put the country in a general state of celebration and joy. Thus, the fortune of our Sultan has extended to the entire nation and has blessed it with a well-deserved distraction from the ongoing crises around the globe."
 turkey_osp_events.33.t:9 "Fevzi Çakmak's Failed Revolt"
 turkey_osp_events.33.d:9 "Despite the fall of Kemal's government, Fevzi Çakmak decided to continue the struggle and go into hiding, although it was clear to all he could only expect to be arrested. In the clique of the OHF's main supporters - the military - he was in third place, after Kemal himself and Ismet - with some daring to challenge the latter's place in favour of Fevzi. So Müşir had few options left - either surrender now and be arrested, or revolt hoping to change the situation in the country.\nThis morning, hours before the decree banning the OHF and arresting its main members was to be signed, Fevzi and a handful of supporters appeared in the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Müşir gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrages of the new government, even using the deposition of the sultan as an excuse. The garrison, most of whose ranks were connected with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rebels and marched towards the government residence. This is where Fevzi's first blow awaited, as they found no one but minor officials similarly bewildered by the absence of an interim government. Capturing several of the petitioners as 'prisoners', Müşir hastily started sending messages to other regions of the country, hoping to get support from wherever. But it turned out that communications had been blocked and troops loyal to the OSF were already gathering outside the city, led by the legitimate government.\nBy evening, having realised the hopelessness of the situation and unable to gain support from the people in the capital, Fevzi had surrendered to the provisional government. Most of the OHF supporters had also surrendered, except for the most stubborn, who preferred to go on the run again. The government is no longer under any significant threat, and the country has embarked on its inexorable road to democracy."
 turkey_events.4.d:9 "This morning at around 5:30 a.m., gunfire could be heard from the Yildiz Palace where [TUR.GetLeader] resided. At the same time, men stormed the War Ministry and the Sublime Porte and seized control of most major political and military institutions. Aided from within by the city's guards and garrison, a train brought the nationalist leaders to the outskirts of the capital. Mustafa Kemal, his private guard and General Ismet took control of the government, while Fevzi took over the war ministry. Since most of the garrison stationed in the city sided with the nationalists, the few men still loyal to the HİF were unable to form a major resistance. Within an hour, the coup concluded and the power once again fell into the hands of Kemal.\n\nThe news spread throughout the city at lightning speed. Whole processions formed in joy to cheer the saviours of the Empire, and even the Sultan himself officially recognised the new government towards the end of the day. This was a little too late for the Gazi's liking. At noon, he issued a statement as Grand Vizier of the capital of the 'Turkish Empire', as our nation was referred to in the document, announcing the beginning of the reign of his newly formed government and calling for the rescue of the nation from the imperialists and Arab bandits who were endangering it. He promised to undertake the necessary measures to protect the Turkish people and that progress would save them from the horrors they had experienced. Even though the now deposed government still controls some areas of Anatolia, many people have by now already accepted the Grand Vizier's reign, hoping that he will bring peace, freedom, justice and security to his new Empire."
 turkey_events.5.d:9 "After the success of the coup, the government of Kemal took stock of the situation, and realised one thing: The situation looks desperate. Before the new government could implement the promised reforms, it would first have to deal with the internal struggles that plague the nation.\n\nThe first difficulty is obviously the impact the HİF had on the country. Democratic and decentralist reforms will be difficult, but not entirely impossible to reverse. If this goal is to be achieved, it will be necessary to make the people and the administrations understand that the Kemalist reforms are the only things able to save the Empire in these dark times.\n\nHowever, this is not the only task ahead of Kemal and his supporters. They will also have to deal with the economic crisis affecting the country. Indeed, the loss of half of the Empire's land has inevitably had an impact on the general standard of living as well as on the country's productive capacity.\n\nIf Kemal manages to deal with these internal problems, he will surely have regained the trust of the people. Even though the situation may look dire, the Pasha is full of hope and confident in his abilities to lead the people into a brighter future."
 turkey_events.6.d:9 "With the rise of the nationalist party to power, many conservatives saw a return to the Kemalist reforms planned before the election defeat of the OHF. The Shaykh al-Islam himself called on the government to show religious tolerance and respect for traditions, fearing that the Kemalists might trample on these values. Many muftis, hodjas and imams have already organised rallies to protest against the fall of the liberal coalition and the rise of the \"illegitimate nationalist regime\". In the eastern parts of Anatolia, the traditionalist resistance has already become violent, as several gendarmes have been assassinated by Kurdish zealots.\n\n§RThe mechanics of traditionalism are now in place. At the beginning of the Kemalist reforms you can access the percentage of traditionalist resistance. This resistance will be able to define future political events and developments...§!"
 turkey_events.12.d:9 "Sufi orders have long played an important role within the Ottoman Empire, and many of our past Sultans were part of these orders. Initially serving semi-independent from the state apparatus, these orders were brought closer to the central authority of the state during the top-down reforms of the İTC at the start of the 20th century. Reforms included centralisation and bureaucratisation of the brotherhoods, the creation of training courses for Sufi sheikhs, the institution of detailed dress policies, and inspections of the practices of various orders. Slowly but surely, the orders became a part of the Ottoman state itself.\n\nWith their closer attachment to the state, however, came a closer connection to the political scene in Kostantiniye, and although only a minority of the population is part of one of these orders, their deep connection to the men of power has led to unbridled corruption and political influence. Some even go so far as to say that the electoral victory and bestowment of the Grand Vizier title on the leader of the HİF was directly caused by these orders in an attempt to halt the Kemalist reforms.\n\nThe different orders range from the Mevlevi tarikat or \"Whirling Dervishes\" to the more powerful Kadiri tarikat, whose close support of the Sultans has in the past led to them becoming the kingmaker in the capital. As the Grand Vizier has shown his desire to greatly limit the power of these organisations, many of them are attempting to sway uncertain party members to block his proposal. The Sultan himself has also in private conversation with the Grand Vizier and multiple Sheiks from the orders showed his discontent with the direction of the policies his Vizier pursues."
 turkey_events.14.d:9 "One of Gazi Mustafa Kemal's deepest wishes was the creation of a Turkish republic, separate from the minorities who wanted the nation dead. The republic the Gazi dreamed of was to be based on nationalism and democracy. Many party members considered the reform feasible. Indeed, since the 1909 coup d'état by the İTC, the Sultan has merely been a puppet of the governing parties. He does not truly lead the nation anymore, even though Abdülmecid II has been more influential than his predecessors.\n\nIf the reform came into effect, the title of Padishah would be split between the Caliph and the Sultan, with the Sultan retaining his religious but not political authority. Sultan [TUR.GetLeader] could not oppose the measure due to the weakness of his authority.\n\nThe abolition of the Sultanate would be a turning point in world history. It would put a definitive end to the existence of the Ottoman Empire. It would nevertheless also allow for a better implementation of the secularisation planned by Kemal and could overall be considered a great leap forward."
 turkey_events.21.d:9 "The Ottoman Civil Code or Mecca Code is a relic of the Tanzimat period in the modern era and was supposed to balance the Shariah with the laws of the modern world, but it soon became outdated in the İTC period. Kemal's plan was to replace it with a most modern Turkish Civil Code, which was to be inspired by the Civil Codes of other progressive European nations. The Comittee in charge of rewriting the code chose the Swiss one as the model for the new Turkish law. The most significant changes this conversion would bring our nation are modern rights for women on inheritance, marriage and divorce as well as parental rights. With the creation of the new Turkish Civil Code also came the creation of a new and more progressive Commercial Code. While they were both developed when Kemal was still alive, he sadly died without ever seeing them implemented, mostly because the Traditionalist forces tried to stop their implementation by all means. However, with the Traditionalists losing more and more influence to the progressive government of [TUR.GetLeader], the wish of the Gazi can finally be fulfilled and the dream of a new and modern Civil Code realised."
 turkey_events.30.t:9 "The Kadroist Wing of the Party Takes Over"
 turkey_events.34.d:9 "The question of the status of the army is a rather delicate one. Due to the military attachment of the Turkish people, many nationalists and party members are also high-ranking military officials. For example, famous politicians like Ismet, Recep and Kemal were all part of the military at some point. Also, there are people like Fevzi and Fahrettin, who are still serving in the military despite their political commitment. However, as we noticed during the HİF period, the presence of the army can lead to coups against the government in place if the political situation is not to its liking, which was quite useful in bringing the OHF to power. Nevertheless, with the Kemalist reforms and the resistance they've sparked, an intervention of the military would be less than ideal.\n\nWe have to make a decision: We could either leave the army under the control of the government and maintain the status quo, or we could separate it completely from politics by forbidding military personnel to hold political positions. Obviously, this could make some of our officers unhappy, but ultimately it would hopefully help to secure the government from military coups."

 turkey_events.59.t:9 "Sultan [ROOT.GetLeader] and Mustafa Kemal Killed!"
 turkey_events.59.d:9 "Today, shortly after noon, a sudden explosion shook the city of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. The blast came from the palace of our beloved Sultan [OTT_GetSultanCommonName], who at the time was meeting with Grand Vizier Musta Kemal Gelibolu to discuss how the government should proceed now that the Empire had been shattered and crushed. Without notice nor warning, these discussions came to an early end when a hidden bomb exploded, wrecking the front of the palace and leaving bystanders in shock. Fearing for the life of their Sultan, nearby observers rushed to help, but it was all in vain. Among the debris, only the disfigured bodies of Osman, the Grand Vizier, and members of the palace guard could be found.\n\nNaturally, the untimely demise of the Sultan meant chaos. The news spread quickly, first throughout the city and then throughout the entire nation. Upon hearing of the Sultan's death, Refet Bele decided to take his chances. Stating his fear of an imminent collapse of the nation into anarchy as the reason, he rallied the most important politicians of the opposition and the majority of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s garrison around him and marched towards the major government buildings of the city, taking control of them within the span of a few hours. The general confusion and uncertainty following the Sultan's demise prevented the remaining government officials from organising much of a resistance, and subsequently, the coup was over just as quickly as it had begun. With his position secured, Refet Bele declared himself the new Head of State and the Ottoman Salvation Party the new government, and stated that he aims to use his powers to secure law and order in the nation and to find the terrorists responsible for the Sultan's death.\n\nHowever, this riddle might prove hard to solve, as the police have thus far found no clues that might lead to the traitors. People have, however, already started throwing wild accusations around, with some blaming Kurdish or Armenian nationalists, whilst others have even denounced Refet Bele himself. Sadly, it seems likely that the truth is never going to be revealed."
 turkey_events.59.a:9 "We weep for our Sultan and our Ghazi."
 turkey_events.60.d:9 "The defeat in the Levant Crisis was the most devastating catastrophe our nation had to experience in a very long time. We were forced to concede almost all of our non-Turkish territories, thousands of men lost their lives and even more their homes. Naturally, this led to the people losing trust in their government and especially in the capabilities of the armed forces. However, many high-ranking officers don't think that the army is at fault, shifting the entire blame to the liberal government instead. According to them, the HİF neglected the army and didn't pursue an efficient defence policy, resulting in the downfall of our once great Empire.\n\nFearing that the liberals won't be able to get the nation out of its spiral of tragedies and disasters, Field Marshal Fevzi Çakmak, one of the most respected officers of our armed forces, decided to no longer sit by idly. He rallied a few politicians of the OHF around him, gathered a group of supporting officers and mobilised soldiers loyal to his cause. Then, he marched on to the centre of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he surrounded the liberal government. Once the HİF politicians realised that they had no realistic chance of resisting Fevzi's troops, they surrendered to the Müşîr, who then arrested them for \"treason against the Empire and its people\". After the liberals had been dealt with, Fevzi declared himself the new Head of State. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the entire nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory.\n\nEven though the people admire Fevzi for his military achievements, many still question his ability to govern the nation efficiently. Seeing how Fevzi was once a dear friend of Kemal, some also fear that his coup will mean a return to the policies of the OHF - which are dreaded by some parts of the population. Only time will tell if the fears and uncertainties of the people are justified..."
 turkey_events.61.d:9 "When he took power, the Müşîr promised that he'd use his powers to secure the continued survival of our nation and to fight the enemies of the state. Until now, it has been left deliberately unclear who exactly these enemies are, but today, Fevzi decided to answer this question in a speech.\n\n\"When I look at the Empire, I see a once great nation that has been utterly destroyed by its enemies. And I see these enemies kicking our state while it's already down. My Turkish friends, you might be asking yourselves: 'Who are these enemies you are seeing?' Well, this is a question I will gladly answer. The first enemy I can see is the liberal opposition to my rule. Many of the idiotic members of the former HİF still haven't realised that it was their system that led to the downfall of the Empire - and that their system would mean the total nullification of any chance our nation still has to return to its former glory. This is why I will fight these liberal pigs with everything I have until their brains are finally freed of the leftist poison. But, this is not all. I see another enemy. One that has emerged after our defeat in the Levant Crisis. This enemy is our current economic situation. It prevents us from reaching the prosperity and peace all of us desire. We cannot grow if our economy is destroyed and our production rate minuscule. We'll have to rebuild our economy before we can start thinking about anything else.\"\n\nWith these words, Fevzi has made his priorities clear. Now, all that remains to be seen is how he will go about defeating the enemies that he has now revealed, and if the population agrees with this new enemy image."
 turkey_events.92.d:9 "A few days ago, the Sheikhs, Aghas and Chiefs of Kurdistan met in Diyarbekir to discuss the future of their people. Initially, nobody thought that they would come to an agreement, considering how many of them were archenemies not that long ago. Surprisingly, the meeting didn't fall apart instantly. In fact, the discussion stayed relatively civil and without any unexpected incidents. It appears that they've realised that they're stronger if they fight united and under one banner — a dangerous sign. About a day after the meeting started, it became clear that the majority of the Kurdish leaders were in favour of Kurdish independence, saying that they want to free their people from their Turkish overlords. This led them to proclaim the independence of the State of Kurdistan this morning. Knowing that we'll never accept this, they immediately thereafter called the Kurds to arms, claiming that this fight will finally bring them their long-desired freedom from the \"Turkish yoke\". Thousands are heeding the call and joining the revolt against our rule. However, there are barely any experienced soldiers within the ranks of the Kurds, which consist mostly of inexperienced farmers, nomads and tribesmen. This means that our army, although not in a very good state, should have no problem dealing with this revolt. It's about time we show the Kurds their place!"
 turkey_events.118.t:9 "Fevzi Çakmak's Failed Revolt"
 turkey_events.118.d:9 "This morning Fevzi and a group of his supporters appeared at the barracks of the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] garrison, where Müşir gave a fervent speech calling for an end to the outrage by the new government, accusing Fahrettin of installing his own dictatorship through the \"puppet\" OSF. The garrison, most of whose ranks were associated with the OHF, quickly enough sided with the rioters and marched towards the government residence. On the way they were joined by a large crowd. The soldiers guarding the residence were too few to resist, so all the key OSF leaders were captured by Fevzi, except Fahrettin himself, who had managed to flee the town to the newly cantoned units called in from the east near the city.\nBy midday the situation was still difficult - although loyal OSF units had surrounded the [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the rebels had no intention of surrendering. Fahrettin was unwilling to storm the city as he feared it would endanger the lives of other members of the government. Suddenly Prince Ömer Faruk, who had managed to get out of the palace unnoticed, arrived at his headquarters. Many foretold this brave man's future as the new sultan when the provisional government will be ready to summon the rightful ruler to the throne. As he approached Fahrettin, he declared his support for the OSF's policies and even his willingness to personally participate in the storming of the capital. He also showed the Sancak-ı Şerif - or Sacred Banner, a priceless relic from Allah's time, kept in the palace and only brought out during battles. The last time this happened was over 100 years ago during the last rebellion of the Janissary Corps. Although the ancient ceremonial was flagrantly flouted, Ömer proposed the use of the banner - the first time the future Sultan had marched to siege his capital in this way.\nOn hearing of Ömer's joining the Fahrettin, Fevzi's ardour diminished. The assault began under the cover of night, when most of the common supporters of the OHF had dispersed - and ended successfully. The government members were released and the leader of the uprising himself was taken into prison."

However, since there were no troops ready to support him, the Defender of Medina realised his situation and surrendered to the authorities.\nUnexpectedly, Fevzi did not declare himself the leader of the country, but reinstated the previous sultan, who had been deposed not more than a month before, to the throne, and became Grand Vizier under him. Naturally, the sultan had no choice but to submit. Not long after the coup had concluded, he gave a speech, which was broadcasted to the whole nation over the radio. In it, he informed the people of the change in politics and assured them that from now on, their voices would be heard, and that under his lead, our nation would return to its former glory."

His father used his contacts and power to guarantee young Ömer would get the best education available in the Empire, at the Galatasaray Lycée, Turkey's oldest high school. When he was 11 years old, it was decided that he should attend a European school instead, and, as such, the young prince was sent to the Theresianum Military Academy in Vienna, where he not only learned valuable lessons about military strategies, but also about carpentry, masonry, and other manual skills. After spending a few years in Vienna, he was transferred to the Prussian Military Academy in Potsdam, where he received a more disciplined training.\n\nNot long after he graduated from the academy in 1914, the Weltkrieg broke out. During the first stages of the war, Ömer fought for the Germans, first in Galicia and later on also in Verdun. For his bravery in battle, he was awarded a golden cigarette case, the Red Eagle medal, and the Iron Cross of the First Degree, together with a signed photograph of the Kaiser himself. However, as the Weltkrieg was nearing its end, Ömer was recalled to the Ottoman Empire, for which he fought for the remainder of the conflict.\n\nAfterwards, he remained a relatively important figure in the Ottoman military, chaired the football club Fenerbahçe S.K., and befriended ex-İTC members such as Refet Bele. His relatively peaceful life was disrupted by the outbreak of the Levant Crisis, during which he once again fought in the name of the Empire. Even so, the war did not end well for the Ottoman state - and for Ömer, the incapable government was to blame. With the blessing of his allies in the OSF, he was able to enforce his claim to the throne, and now that he rules over the Empire, he seeks to succeed where the Sultans before him had failed and to bring glory to the downhearted nation.§!"
 UKR_Relief_Bill_desc:9 "The so-called Hetman Coalition - a parliamentary alliance between the §cUDkhP§!, §aUSKhD§!, representatives of §mVSZV§! and §mProtofis§! and certain §CIndependent Deputies§! - has struggled to maintain a veneer of political stability and unity since its inception in 1924. Botched land reform and stalled industrialisation are just part of its legacy of factionalism and petty politics.

For Ukrainians, one of their most significant myths concerns the events of January 29, 1918. On this date, some 500 cadets defended the Kruty railway station, 150 kilometres northwest of [202.GetName], against a vastly superior Bolshevik force. Around a hundred defenders fell before the survivors were forced to withdraw, but their sacrifice delayed the Bolshevik advance on [202.GetName] and allowed the People's Republic to conclude the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk before evacuating the city.\n\nThe Battle of Kruty received little notice at the time, for [202.GetName] was in chaos due to a simultaneous revolt at the city arsenal - but when the Republic returned to the city in March, the battle's myth began to be built. The remains of [202.GetName]'s defenders were ceremoniously reburied to eulogies from high-ranking politicians, and Skoropadskyi established a commemorative tradition early into his reign, supposedly approving the monument to Kruty's fallen that was later erected at the site. However, remembrances of the battle has also been politicised to a degree. Hetmanist figures, including Otaman-Minister Doroshenko, sometimes view the battle as evidence of the Republic's incompetence: their (factually dubious) view is of young, inexperienced, and under-equipped students being abandoned by their drunk commanding officers and sent to certain death. Republican commemorations of Kruty are less accusatory.\n\nThe battle is also a focal point of the fringe League of Ukrainian Nationalists, for whom the event perfectly encapsulates their preferred narratives: veneration of martyrdom and the heroic sacrifice of the youth for the nation. OVDV has noted a circulation of LUN pamphlets in the [193.GetName] garrison to mark the occasion, connecting the battle to their brand of military ultranationalism."

 ukraine_events.88.d:9 "It would have been naive to believe that the recent Borotbyst Syndicalist Revolution would have skirted by the Jewish National Council and its internal political developments. Taking into account the national political circumstances, Revolutionary Socialist forces within the Council have sent out a vote of no confidence against the Council's leadership, a clear attempt to replace it with a more leftist makeup. The attempt succeeded and a new leadership race is abound. Due to Goldelman's long-lasting tenure in the Jewish Political Circles, it was decided that he'll occupy a lower-ranking \"Secretary\" post, instead of fully resigning from all leading positions.\n\nInterestingly enough, one of the candidates for the new leadership has been Isaak Babel, a famous Jewish Author from [192.GetName]. Gaining notable fame for his short stories and novels during the interwar, the revelation that Babel had ties to the Bolsheviks during the Civil War has left more questions than answers. Regardless, Babel has quietly rejected his own candidacy and instead sent out a statement congratulating the Leftist Circles in both the National Council, as well as Ukraine at large on a successful revolution."
 ukraine_republican_events.5.d:9 "Immediately, Vynnychenko set out to order Marshal Volokh and General Tiutiunnyk to begin the disarmament of German army units in Ukraine to protect against the incoming coup. There was some worry that as other higher-ups like Petliura could cause trouble, but surely, after Vynnychenko's next act, there would be none who would stand against Ukraine and the second stage of the revolution. That next act was a grandiose speech to the National Zbory, one that would surely become remembered in Ukrainian history for years.\n\n\"For decades, we have fought so that Ukraine may be free. But foreign tyrants have always fought to enslave us! Always and everywhere, for their own selfish gains, they have sought to subjugate the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the face of crushing conditions, we never gave up hope that one day the Hetman would be overthrown, and we still yet hope that we shall resist the Russian aggressors once again.\n\nNow in the west too, they will stop at nothing to exploit Ukraine and the Ukrainian people! The evidence has been made clear:they desire a new April 29th, to destroy the Ukrainian spirit and all we had shed blood for.\n\nWe will not have any of it. We will not make the same mistakes as before. We will fight, and we will win!\""
 ukraine_republican_events.104.d:9 "As a wise man once said, getting into power is one thing — governing is another. Thus far, this statement has rung true for the Workers' Democratic Union too. Their plans of radical action, from the beginning, have been at odds with the restrictive Mitteleuropean institution and the German demands to keep military spending high, not to mention the stifling of Ukrainian domestic industry due to imports from Berlin.\n\nAlready a controversial figure due to being the most prominent liberal in Vynnychenko's cabinet, it is Margolin and his grip on the Foreign Ministry that has received much of the blame, and the radicals in the UPS-R and the R-RB that have done much of the finger pointing. Behind closed doors, the likes of Pisotskyi and Khrystiuk have called for Margolin's outright removal from the office, stating that his negligence in negotiating more \"pro-Ukrainian\" terms with Germany have shown him unfit for the office, as well as detrimental to the ruling bloc as a whole.\n\nYet Margolin did not become Foreign Minister to offer an olive branch to the defeated URDP, but to secure recognition of the most left leaning government in Mitteleuropa to date. So far, it seems Margolin has at least kept Germany at arms' length, assuring them that Vynnychenko and his cabinet do not seek any conflicts.\n\nStill, the calls to remove Margolin over this so-called \"negligence\" have only ramped up, after months of so far slow but steady social reforms. Though Vynnychenko has been silent over the matter so far, it is inevitable he must make a decision soon..."
 ukraine_republican_events.106.d:9 "Out of the many appointed to Vynnychenko's Council of Ministers, a familiar face stuck out. That face is Arnold Margolin: a Jewish Ukrainian and URDP member who served in the judicial system as well as the foreign ministry of the Hetman's state.\n\nMargolin's record as a defence lawyer is truly noteworthy, as he became known nationwide for his involvement in the widely publicised \"Beilis Tria\" more than twenty years ago. At a time when antisemitism in the Russian Empire was rampant, Margolin skillfully defended the Jewish worker from the accusations of ritual sacrifice. Though Margolin was not the only one defending Menachem Beilis, he still gained a reputation as someone who would defend the rights of minorities in Ukraine, especially the large Jewish population.\n\nBut though that trial has earned him great fame, it is not why he was selected to be Vynnychenko's Foreign Minister. All are too aware of German distrust of the Workers' Democratic Union, and we cannot intend to erupt all of that prematurely. Margolin's experience in the foreign ministry previously, as well as his URDP membership, have shaped an important compromise between [202.GetName] and Berlin - one that, for now, must last if we are to survive.\n\nIt is not a compromise anyone is happy with. Margolin has extensive contacts among his fellow party members, as well as Chief of Staff Petliura, and there is little doubt that he will use the post to influence the revolutionary government in whatever way he can."
 ukraine_republican_events.107.d1:9 "Deciding to heed Kovalevskyi's advice, Vynnychenko arranged a private meeting with Margolin to discuss the ongoing issue. When Vynnychenko relayed to Margolin that many in the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly wanted to remove him from his post, the latter responded saying that such calls were not new.\n\nApparently, he was knowledgeable of the magnitude of situation, too. A suggestion to reshuffle positions in the Foreign Ministry was rejected by Margolin when brought up, as he believed that it would not only encourage Germany to openly make moves against Vynnychenko's government but also do little to please the radicals in the R-RB and the UPS-R. Several hours of discussion between the Chairman and the Foreign Minister went back and forth, but ultimately, they seemed to yield little results.\n\nOnly a day later, the outcome of the meeting became apparent. In a carefully delivered speech to a Workers' Democratic Union meeting, Vynnychenko warned against \"petty infighting and factionalism\", emphasising unity in the face of overwhelming reactionary forces. While he did not mention Margolin in particular, the statement was clearly intended to defend his post and discourage any attempt by the National Zbory to remove him. It is likely that, at least for now, Vynnychenko's words will salvage Margolin's grasp on the ministry - but the situation cannot be considered resolved, and both men have come out of it unfavourably."
 ukraine_republican_events.109.d:9 "After nearly twenty years in exile, the socialists of the Workers' Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Workers' Party have truly turned the political tables. The fall of \"Hetmanist conservatism\" has been sudden and rapid, and the Ukrainian people, at least for the near future, have rejected it completely, as evidenced by the socialist electoral victory.\n\nThat is the version of events we would have liked to see, at least.\n\nOut of the many smaller parties who barely gained enough seats to remain in the National Zbory, one in particular stood out: the Ukrainian People's Party (UNP). Now the largest right wing party in the Assembly, the UNP was formed sometime during election season, where it seemingly gained little traction. But though their presence in the Assembly is small, they have made their mark on the streets by organising protests against the Workers' Democratic Union's \"Bolshevik\" policies.\n\nThe party is led by Mykola Mikhnovskyi, a former Hetmanist and previously a candidate for UDKhP leadership who ostensibly left the party to leave behind Hetmanist connections in a Republican age. Wherever these right-wing protests go, Mikhnovskyi has made impassionate speeches painting the RDS as a 'gathering of traditionally feeble intelligentsia, far removed from the struggles and needs of the Ukrainian nation'. His efforts may be few and far between for now, but in comparison to other disgraced Hetmanist figures, Mikhnovskyi's populist rhetoric and political expertise may prove a greater threat than we could have imagined."
 ukraine_republican_events.114.d:9 "It is certainly a tall task to undo the two decades of damage the Hetman and his government inflicted on society. As Udovychenko's forces closed in on [202.GetName] and began the final assault, a special committee was created so that the perpetrators of said damage would be prosecuted for their crimes against the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe Special Committee to Investigate the Crimes of the Ukrainian State, as it is formally known, consisted of deputies from the National Zbory from across the political aisle early on, and continues to do so to this day. In theory, the Committee is to be impartial, but some of its membership has come under harsh criticism lately by some in the recently inaugurated National Zbory — specifically, the URDP members serving in the Committee.\n\nWith the URDP a minority in the National Zbory, and the Committee responsible to the latter, a proposal has been put forth: one who serves on the Committee must not have served in the Hetmanist \"State Soim\" due to potentially conflicting interests, nor been part of a political party that participated in it. In practice, this would bar any member of the URDP from serving in the committee, and their positions would be left to either USDRP, R-RB or UPS-R delegates.\n\nNaturally, the proposal has far reaching consequences and is extremely controversial. During the election, the left-leaning parties painted the URDP as a gang of secret Hetmanist sympathisers who were uncommitted to the revolution, only joining the Anti-Hetman Revolt on the Republican side when it became convenient to do so. Rhetoric is one thing, however - restricting the abilities of a political party simply through association is another."
 ukraine_republican_events.115.d1:9 "For a provisional government like that of the Ukrainian People's Republic during the revolt, mistakes were expected to happen — rebuilding the bureaucracy and reorganising the army is no small feat, after all. But it was shortly after the revolt that the provisional government made its greatest mistake yet, a mistake the Workers' Democratic Union has come to greatly abhor: the pardoning of Prisovskyi.\n\nIt is an even greater crime from the borderline bonapartist Petliura administration to not only pardon Prisovskyi, but reintegrate him back into the People's Army. Attempts to conceal Prisovskyi's actions during the revolt have fallen short: there is clear as day evidence that Prisovskyi ordered a bombing raid on the republican regional headquarters in Sarny, which led to the deaths of more than a hundred people. Yet, despite his crimes, today he is a free man. Many have correctly pointed out this unreasonable hypocrisy — after all, we convicted the Hetman, did we not?\n\nIt fell to Vynnychenko's government to deliver justice to those murdered by Prisovskyi's immoral acts. In a highly politicised trial, Prisovskyi argued that it was necessary to do everything in his power to prevent a \"Bolshevik takeover\", and that none of his political associations then were declared illegal until after the Hetman's defeat.\n\nFor the most part, however, his arguments fell on deaf ears. Prisovskyi was found guilty of organising state violence against the Ukrainian people, ordering executions, and more - but the question remains of how harsh the sentence should be."

 ukraine_republican_events.119.d2:9 "Not too long ago, in the midst of the Anti-Hetman Revolt, it was the Belarusians who stood up in solidarity with the Ukrainian people against the Hetman when nobody else would. The Belarusian People's Republic has served as a bastion of social democracy in a region of Europe mostly dominated by German business interests and reactionary autocrats, and ever since the success of our revolution the ties between the two have only strengthened.\n\nThat is why Chairman Vynnychenko organised a visit to Minsk to repay the Belarusians for their help and further the bond between our two democracies. There, Vynnychenko took a stand at the State Sojm to applaud the ruling BSDP government of their accomplishments — and save for some rather specific circumstances, there would have been nothing notable about the tour.\n\nThose specific circumstances are of the BSDP itself. While the party champions itself as the torch of progress for the young Belarusian state, it is dominated by rightist tendencies who do not truly seek socialism, and their land reform agenda, the \"Plan Sierada\", has been considerably frustrated by increasing compensation to landowners. In some ways, these are understandable - Germany would not hesitate to send in the troops if the party did not make considerable concessions.\n\nThese unfortunate realities do not at all serve our interests, but the BSDP still contains a sizeable and influential left wing that has consistently been sidelined in policymaking matters. With rumoured sympathisers as high up as Chairman Taraškievič himself, there is potential to make them pliable for real socialism. Should we prepare the necessary means and fund the left wing enough using whatever means we can - financial or otherwise - taking control of Belarus as we kickstart our revolution will be a very costly endeavour, but a greatly beneficial one if it succeeds."
 ukraine_republican_events.120.d:9 "'Vynnychenko would have you believe that the main enemy are the perfidious forces of capital, but make no mistake: the main enemy is in Moscow! By sabotaging our governance and internal order with socialist revolutionary nonsense they render us powerless in the face of the Russian threat'.\n\nThese kinds of fiery oratories were spoken by none other than Mikhnovskyi himself at the latest UNP rally in Kharkiv. Mikhnovskyi's UNP has found itself making significant gains in the city's population who are deeply concerned of a Russian invasion, knowing that if war were to come they would be one of the first targets.\n\nUnfortunately, Mikhnovskyi's party has not fizzled out immediately as we had hoped. A promise of a new Ukrainian future — not Hetmanist nor socialist — has become quite the successful message, and Mikhnovskyi has been touring the countryside and urban areas to shore up support for a conservative voter base that will challenge the left.\n\nEven more worrying is Mikhnovskyi's connections to other prominent conservatives, who have increasingly left behind Hetmanist politics to rally behind the UNP. Chief among them are the likes of Yurii Kollard, Ivan Lutsenko, and Opanas Andriievskyi — including Mikhnovskyi, all have acted as Ukrainian independence advocates early on, openly challenging the Workers' Democratic Union's grip on the national narrative.\n\nThe initial 'lineup' was later joined by a cast of younger generation of rightist thinkers and culturalists such as Yevhen Malaniuk, Leonid Mosendz and most notably, Makar Kushnir. The notoriety of Kushnir's ideological and publicistic work and overall ability of the UNP to expand its base of support beyond the long-time \"veterans\" of the national struggle has drawn notable concern in our government circles."
 ukraine_republican_events.127.d:9 "A serious complication has been noted coming from the Ministry of the Interior: the leadership of the UNP is coming under investigation. While there has been no official statement by Pisotskyi just yet, one can only guess the reason for the investigation. The UNP has thus far acted as one of the strongest right wing opposition parties to the Workers' Democratic Union, and, seemingly in an effort to decapitate their irksome influence, are being painted as foreign implants, receiving money from opposing countries' intelligence services to destabilise the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe timing of the investigations are not coincidental. Under Pisotskyi's pen name \"Andrii Richytsky\", a new article has been published in the R-RB newspaper, Nova Doba (New Life). The article, titled \"On the Matter of Public Vigilance in the Age of Advancing Socialism\", calls for \"rigorous measures against counterrevolutionary forces\". While Pisotskyi has always acted as a hardliner force in the R-RB and the Workers' Democratic Union in general, his language in this particular piece has rightfully been seen as unusually bellicose, even towards other members of the Union."
 ukraine_republican_events.138.d:9 "Word has reached the governing coalition that, due to a lack of evidence, it is most likely that Kushnir will be acquitted. In of itself this is not a defeat for the Workers' Democratic Union, but there are worries that the ongoing protests may lead to one. The URDP and UNP have shown an unprecedented level of solidarity with each other, cooperation once thought unlikely despite socialist dominance in the National Zbory. Disunited, neither of them are a threat to the RDS, but they could be a serious threat should they overcome their differences.\n\nPisotskyi, along with his allies, have cautioned against handing a 'victory' to the UNP now when they are the height of their publicity, as it could be disastrous for the ruling coalition. Instead, they have advocated to inform the URDP in general that they are not, nor will they be, targeted in any investigations from the Special Committee — and to shift the focus from Shulhyn's delegations to the UNP's \"foreign contacts\". According to Pisotskyi, there is scattered evidence that the UNP have received large donations from foreign, reactionary powers. As a member of the UNP's Foreign Affairs Committee, it is not only possible, but probable that if this evidence holds water, then Kushnir is involved.\n\nOn the other hand, some see this prolonging of the investigations as unnecessary and would only be seen as further persecution from the rightists. It may not be a good look for the RDS to simply let the issue go, but perhaps it's the best and most reasonable option. After all, the UNP is probably not as strong as some in the coalition have made them out, and the protests will fade once Kushnir is acquitted."

The rest of the piece is no less critical, and what's worse, it doesn't seem to be merely an outcry of a fringe radical. Indeed, our latest decision regarding the accountability of the People's Militia raised a lot of questions and objections. This article, while especially provocative, is just a manifestation of a wider discontent.\n\nWhile we maintain that defence of the Republic requires streamlined and rationalised control over security forces, there are some amendments that can be made. We can define a procedure, in which certain cases will allow local legislatures to overrule a deployment of the People's Militia, authorised by the central government, provided there is the 2/3 majority behind the motion. Given how fractured local assemblies tend to be and that exact procedure will be still designed by our government, the practical effect will be negligible. Still, sometimes a symbolic concession is exactly the thing that can sway public opinion."
 ukraine_republican_events.176.d:9 "The failure of the National Defence Act has shown deep political divisions at a time when we cannot afford them. Much debate now surrounds why it failed: was the political importance of the land reform too deep-rooted for such a change in budget priorities? Was it due to grievances and petty angers between the two parties at the top, the URDP and USDRP? Or was the belief that Russia would invade soon seen as too farfetched, too nonsensical given German military dominance in Europe?\n\nRecent statements by the Russian foreign minister, as well as fears that Communard aggression towards Germany could spiral into a greater conflict, have only contributed to the worry that the bill's failure may be more costly than imagined. Proponents of the act, many of whom are concentrated in Mikhnovskyi's UNP and other right wing figures, have loudly denounced the bill's failure, citing it as one of the greatest failures of the restored people's republic. If Ukraine cannot defend itself because it failed to recognise the importance of a domestic military industry and the dangers of increasing Russian revanchism, then the only ones to blame will be the ruling coalition.\n\nThe army had not taken the bill's failure well, either. Behind closed doors, members of the nationalist \"Sichovyky\" group in the army, in particular General Konovalets, have expressed extreme disappointment in the National Zbory. There have even been murmurs that, should the coalition continue to fail to uphold its duties to the nation, then military interference in politics may become a serious problem.\n\nThe reality of an imminent Russian invasion is beginning to set in.

It was a surprise that the URDP's right faction, in particular, largely voted for the proposal; they probably believed that, come the next elections, this decision would backfire on the social democrats.\n\nAs of today, the title of \"President of the Ukrainian People's Republic\" has been established, and all of the powers that come with it."
 ukraine_republican_events.207.d:9 "Despite whispers of a potential change in course, the UPS-R's radical leadership, concentrated around Nykyfir Hryhoriiv and Pavlo Khrystiuk, has held on.\n\nWhile it may have been expected that their electoral defeat a year ago would have led for the Socialist-Revolutionaries to reconsider their platform, at the latest party conference such notions were not brought up. The idea of a reapproachment with the Social Democrats were also dismissed due to the apparent \"slowness and inefficiency of the land reform\".\n\nWith this development, the UPS-R's moderate faction, centred around Mykola Kovalevskyi, continues to be somewhat marginalised. It is unlikely that it will gain significant prominence anytime soon, either, barring unforeseen circumstances."
 ukraine_republican_events.261.d:9 "As the years go by, we have become pelted by calls for a new generation of politicians to rise to the occasion. “We need new leaders, new ideas and new personalities”, they say. “Fair enough”, we respond. With Russia's defeat rather imminent, it has been decided to hold a special party congress for the Ukrainian Radical Democratic Party. Nevertheless, controversy ensued almost immediately.\n\nThe only candidate to be elected to the Central Committee without much opposition was Tymish Olesiiuk, a principal state functionary in the Interior and Education ministries, former military officer and a leader of the Podlachian-Ukrainian emigrant community. His election to the position invited little dissent, and he was voted in by an overwhelming majority of party delegates. It certainly helped that Mr. Olesiiuk openly associated himself with the party's centrist majority.\n\nBut afterwards, things went dicey. With only two more Central Committee member spots left, two opposing pairs of politicians went up for consideration. On one hand, there was Oleksandr Yurchenko and Yevhen Glovinskyi. Yurchenko, a top legal scholar, and Glovinskyi, a former officer and economics and engineering professor, both associated themselves with the leftist faction (particularly associated with Nikovskyi). They invoked major scepticism from the rightists, who accused the two of being 'out of touch acamedicians'.\n\nOn the other hand, there was also Vasyl Dubrovskyi and Mykhailo Vetukhiv. Dubrovskyi, a notable historian, and Vetukhiv, a famed veterinarian and biologist, have instead pivoted towards Mr. Dolenko's caucus, with all three being based in Kharkiv. This, naturally, shut off possible support from the leftists, who accused the pair of being \"irrelevant bookmen\".\n\nGiven that the Centrists command a sizable plurality, their votes will decide the outcome. Which turns out to be..."

Despite the reactionary and radical elements that sought to undermine American freedom, in the true spirit of democracy - the Republican President Landon has announced that the 1940 elections will proceed as usual. Seeking a second term, most observers have predicted that Landon will secure the White House for another four years. The wartime presidency has shown remarkable resilience and determination in the face of such a national crisis. At a time when Americans held such little faith in their government, it was Landon's voice on the radio that encouraged loyalists to remain loyal to the federal government.\n\nRunning against him will be Alben Barkley of the Democratic Party. While few think that the Democratic Party will be able to contest the popularity of the Republican leadership, it is never too late for a comeback. In his early political career, Barkley stunned the locals in his native McCracken County with his eloquence and likeability in his bid for county attorney. From there, Barkley has worked his way up to Kentucky political clout, securing the positions of state representative, governor, and later a senator. In the same way, he ran for governor, Barkley has earned the nickname \"Iron Man\" from the press due to his seemingly endless source of energy, as he has been seen offering nearly sixteen speeches a day on the campaign trail.\n\nWith the full resumption of free elections in the United States, the time has come for American voters to make their decisions at polls across the country.

The general publicly announced his appointment of Senator Arthur Vandenberg as his successor and his subsequent withdrawal from presidential affairs.

With the American nation waiting anxiously for news of the eventual reunification, the government of [ACC.GetNameDef] sent a strongly worded note to the Federal Government - demanding that MacArthur be tried for his crimes against the American people in exchange for unification. After all, it was MacArthur's military coup of the American government in the bleak winter of 1937 that threw the nation into anarchy. But perhaps most surprising is that the general's choice, newly appointed President Arthur Vandenberg, has been one of the most vocal voices calling for MacArthur's arrest. President Vandenberg has taken to the national radio to denounce MacArthur as a Caesarean dictator, receiving praise and support from [ACC.GetNameDef].

Nevertheless, Long has reached out to Roosevelt, hoping to have a productive relationship with his new vice president. Some have even hoped that an influential Roosevelt may serve to moderate Long's more radical tendencies.

 united_states_leadup_events.108.d:9 "$united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d$\n\nThough things initially seemed to go to plan, a well prepared defence in the valley halfway to Harlan itself stopped the first \"Red\" force in its tracks. As an inexperienced militia, they were routed after taking significant casualties by the more professional anti-union militia, armed with machine guns and, concerningly, dubiously procured artillery pieces. After a brief pursuit where the militia dispersed the Reds with heavy fire, the Red formation crumbled, with many being captured and others being forced into the hills and mountains.\n\nThe northern advance having failed, the southern attack was doomed from the beginning. Though they managed to capture the union stronghold of the New Harlan Hotel, they were unable to reach the courthouse, let alone the National Guard Depot where they were meant to meet up with the northern force. Having boxed in the local force, the anti-union militia squeezed ever harder on the boxed in Reds before forcing them to surrender.\n\nIn the aftermath, a state of white terror has emerged in Harlan. Retreated Reds found in the hills have been hunted and killed by the militia, and known union sympathisers have been murdered in their homes. Extrajudicial anti-union violence now reigns in Harlan."
 united_states_leadup_events.113.d:9 "$united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d$\n\nInitially, the \"Red\" force achieved many key objectives, successfully capturing much of the Cumberland valley. Though the anti-union militia was more professional and relatively well armed, with machine guns and, concerningly, dubiously procured artillery pieces, it was forced to retreat due to the numerical advantage of the Reds, who advanced through the valley, capturing it to both sides of the entrance to Martin's fork, which leads to the town of Harlan itself. It was on the fork however that the first Red force was halted, due both to it having split in two in order to capture the western section of the valley, as well as due to the reinforcement of the anti-union militia.\n\nThat reinforcement however came at the expense of the anti-unionists in Harlan itself. Sheriff Middleton's men were pushed north of clover fork, with the southern Reds capturing both the courthouse and the hospital. In western Harlan, the anti-unionists formed a redoubt surrounding the National Guard Depot, locked in a stalemate with a larger but less well-armed Red force.\n\nHarlan county, now in a state of outright war, is locked in a stalemate. The Reds in the city cannot move north to reinforce their comrades, lest they lose the town itself. Similarly, Middleton's contingent cannot move north, lest the depot and its small arsenal fall into the hands of the Reds."
 united_states_leadup_events.119.d:9 "$united_states_leadup_events.harlanintro.d$\n\nFrom the beginning, the \"Reds\" caught the anti-union militia off guard, and they were unable to make an effective stand when the Reds entered the Cumberland valley. The further through the valley they pushed, the more the anti-union resistance crumbled, leaving behind their equipment as they retreated, including machine guns and dubiously procured artillery pieces. Even as the Reds split to capture both Martin's fork and the western Cumberland, they faced little resistance on either front, holding both sides of the valley in Harlan County.\n\nWith their northern flank having been compromised, the defence of the town of Harlan itself was a lost cause from the beginning. Though Sheriff Middleton's forces were able to create a perimeter surrounding the National Guard Depot, the Reds quickly captured the rest of the town, including both the courthouse and the hospital. Once the northern contingent met up with the Reds in the town itself, the anti-union militia's resistance became untenable. Surrounded and outgunned, they surrendered.\n\nNow, the entirety of Harlan County is under union rule. Unlike in the Mingo County War, the union's militia has not dispersed: instead, it has become the primary law enforcement body in the county, while guarding the entrances to the county with its newly acquired heavy weapons. What comes next is uncertain, but it is clear that this is the most significant insurrection in the United States since the Civil War."

Congressional moderates, satisfied that the bill does not substantially violate the rights of the existing stakeholders in America's banks, gave their tepid support to the president's proposal, giving us a significant legislative win in the first weeks of the administration.\n\nThough the proposal is a significantly altered version of Father Coughlin's original plan, we still find cause for celebration. The interests of the American people will now be seen and heard in the halls of the highest financial decision making in this country, a stark change of pace from the smoke-filled rooms of Wall Street.\n\nNevertheless, our victory is not absolute. The new elected banking board is not solely comprised of representatives of the American people. Instead, it also includes representatives from business, and even the stakeholders of the banks themselves. Though we have inserted the interests of the people into banking governance, for now we will have to temper the expectations of our supporters, who demand an immediate transformation in our country's financial system which is not possible at this moment."
